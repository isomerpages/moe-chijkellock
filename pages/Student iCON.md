<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>1. <u>How can my child log in to Student iCON?</u>
</p>
<p>Student iCON is web-based. Students can use their web browser in their
internet- enabled computing or mobile devices to visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yangzhengpri.moe.edu.sg/files/Student%20iCON%20Onboarding%20Guide.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://workspace.google.com/dashboard</u></a>&nbsp;to

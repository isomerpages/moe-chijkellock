<h4><strong>CHIJ Kellock Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</strong></h4>
<img style="width: 20%;" src="/images/alp1.jpg" />
<p>The ALP Programme at Kellock Connects classroom learning with&nbsp;<strong><u>real-life applications</u></strong>&nbsp;and encourages students to&nbsp;<strong><u>creatively apply concepts to solve authentic problems.&nbsp;</u></strong>It focuses on evoking curiosity in learning, developing inventive thinking and encouraging a dare-to-try spirit.</p>
<img style="width: 70%;" src="/images/alp2.jpg" />
<p>Our school hope to encourage all students to<strong><u>&nbsp;&lsquo;Innovate to Make a Difference&rsquo;,</u></strong>&nbsp;which embodies the school&rsquo;s aspirations and drive in realising the tenets of our school&rsquo;s vision of &lsquo;Learn&rsquo;, &lsquo;Lead&rsquo; and &ldquo;Make a Difference&rdquo;. The Kellock Girl Outcomes (KGOs) of a &lsquo;Thoughtful Learner&rsquo; (Learn), &lsquo;Servant Leader&rsquo; (Lead) and &lsquo;Person for Others&rsquo; (Make a Difference) are the key outcomes we would like to nurture and grow in all our students.</p>
<img style="width: 40%;" src="/images/alp3.jpg" />
<p>Through the school&rsquo;s Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW), we hope to sharpen and develop attributes of the KGOs, such as Critical and Creative Thinking, Communication skills, Reflective Learning, Leading by Example, Putting Others before Self and Collaborating with Others. The ALP is designed to enable all students to be intentional about solving multi-faceted problems by adopting an interdisciplinary perspective and approach.</p>

<h4><strong>Our ALP Approach and platforms for students at CHIJ Kellock</strong></h4>
<p>The ALP will be delivered through a 3-tiered framework; Offer-Nurture-Excel (Similar to the school&rsquo;s LLP framework). Each tier of the ONE approach takes into consideration our students&rsquo; needs, abilities, interests and development of 21st Century Competencies and SEL Competencies, which leads to the Kellock Girl&rsquo;s Outcomes.The 3-tiered frame is designed to allow students to deepen their appreciation and application of skills progressively.</p>
<p>At the<strong>&nbsp;OFFER</strong>&nbsp;Tier, the school looks at providing a breadth of learning opportunities for students schoolwide. The main vehicles for delivering experiences at this first tier comprise existing programmes such as Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) @ Kellock, Coding and Maker Programme as well as Awareness and STEAM Weeks.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>NURTURE</strong>&nbsp;tier provides in-depth development of the students&rsquo; interest while the&nbsp;<strong>EXCEL</strong>&nbsp;tier allows opportunities for students with the aptitude to excel in their chosen fields or to further stretch their talents. The school plans for extensions to the IPW by offering students with greater interest to extend their advocacy and action of their Project Work via the Kellock Volunteerism Platforms. Similar platforms for change-making exploratory projects that serve the common good are provided for interested student leaders.</p>
<p>To cater to students with aptitude, the school plans for opportunities for selected students to explore and investigate environmental, social and community concerns/ issues at a deeper level through participation in relevant zonal and national presentations and competitions under the EXCEL Tier.</p>
<h4><strong>Primary 5 Interdisciplinary Project Work</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>Building a Sustainable Future - Moving Towards ZERO WASTE<br /></u></strong><br />In our school&rsquo;s signature Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Primary 5 students learnt about the importance of caring for the environment and how they can be the agents of change in creating an environment that is pollution free, by moving towards a ZERO WASTE environment.</p>
<p>As part of Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) experience, students learned about the Singapore Green Plan 2021, 3Rs1U and how we can protect the environment. The virtual talks helped students to empathize with the real-life problems caused by waste and how this impacted the environment.</p>

<p>During IPW, students need to learn to collaborate with their group members to generate ideas on the targeted environmental problems. The group members will start to &lsquo;think outside the box&rsquo; to identify new solutions to the problem that they would like to address. This year students were given the choice to either create a model of their prototype using recyclables or come up with an app design to help reduce waste.</p>

<p>To develop students&rsquo; oral communications skills, P5 students were task to work in groups to prepare for a presentation and share their leaning experiences with their classmates during IPW.</p>

<p>Badminton is an exciting and fast-paced sport that improves coordination, physical and mental agility and sharpens reflexes. During the CCA, students will learn badminton skills and techniques such as the serve, forehand and backhand strokes, underhand and overhead strokes and footwork. Over the 3 years, students in the CCA will progressively learn to refine their techniques and enhance their game play. Students will also learn values such as Respect, Resilience, Fair Play and Sportsmanship through the training programme. Badminton rackets and shuttlecocks will be provided for students during training.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Highlights<br></strong>Students will play against one another in friendly games during CCA to raise their standard of game play over time.</p><p><strong>Teachers-in-charge<br></strong>Mr Vincent Goh and Ms Kavitha</p><p><strong>Day / Time<br></strong>Friday<br>7.30am - 9.30am&nbsp;</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/badmin.png"></div><p></p>

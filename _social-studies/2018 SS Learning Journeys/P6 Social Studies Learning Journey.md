<p>As part of the school&rsquo;s efforts in creating outdoor experiential experiences for our students, a Social Studies cum Science Learning Journey to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve was organised for our Primary 6 students. Our students were introduced to the characterisitcs and adaptations of the flora and fauna in Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve &ndash; a mangrove environment. This encourages our students to develop an appreciation towards nature and in turn, understand the importance of preserving the natural heritage of Singapore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the trip, our students were provided with a folder each. The folder contains information about the wetland reserve and the mangrove environment as well as activities. These information and activities facilitate and enhance our students&rsquo; learning experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the trip, our students used the information collected in their folder to research and present on a chosen organism in groups. On top of that, our students also presented on why they thought it was important to protect and preserve the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve.</p>
<p>This experience allowed for our students to engage in the inquiry process of investigating into authentic societal and environemental issues. We hope that through the processes of negotiating their understandings of these issues, our students will develop into being informed, concerned and reflective citizens who show care for the country and its environment.</p>

<h4><strong>Primary 5 Indian Heritage Centre Learning Journey</strong></h4>
<p>As part of the school&rsquo;s efforts in promoting the importance of maintaining racial harmony in a multi-racial country like Singapore, a learning journey to the Indian Heritage Centre (IHC) located at Little India was organised for our Primary 5 students. The IHC traces the history and of the Indians and Southeast Asian communities in the Southeast Asia region. This is in line with the Primary 5 Social Studies syllabus where students learn about the ancient civilisations and influences of India and its impact on Singapore.</p>
<p>The IHC consists of 5 galleries, a museum shop as well as programming and activity spaces. These spaces had provided our students with a fun and engaging environment to learn about the ancient civilisations. Before the students embarked on their tour, each of them received a Discovery Kit from the IHC. It is a booklet containing puzzles, quizzes and eye-catching visuals to captivate and engage students during their time in the IHC.</p>
<p>Besides touring the galleries and listening to the explanations by the experienced gallery guides, our students also tried their hands on various traditional games (Paramapadham, Pallanguzhi and Five Stones) and art form (Henna). Our students have learnt that these games are not only fun, but also help to develop skills such as critical thinking, concentration and arithmetic. Who would have thought!</p>
<p>Through this experience, our students have gained a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Indian heritage, arts and culture. They have also learnt about the importance of maintaining racial harmony in a multi-racial country like Singapore. We hope that our students have learnt to appreciate and be thankful for the harmonious relationship present between the various races in Singapore.</p>

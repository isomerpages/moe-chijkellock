<h4><strong>Primary 3 Frog Farm Social Studies Learning Journey 2019</strong></h4>
<p>At the heart of all learning is the opportunity to experience, observe and relate. As such, the school organised a field-based learning journey to provide our students with an opportunity to observe, explore and interact with nature in an engaging, educational and safe environment. The objective of this learning journey is for students to gain a deeper understanding of the life cycle of a frog while relating to nature and understanding the importance of having farms in Singapore&rsquo;s increasingly urban cityscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before the learning journey, each of our students received a school-based learning booklet from their teachers. This learning booklet helps them to record their learning throughout their time at the frog farm. It contains questions on the life cycle of a frog as well as some reflection questions to be done during or after the learning journey. This booklet also helps them to consolidate their learning through note-taking and drawing of their observations.</p>

<p>The guides at the frog farm provided our students with a brief history of Jurong Frog Farm and how it all came about. The guides also enhanced our students&rsquo; learning by furnishing them with key facts and information about the American Bullfrogs at the farm by going through 10 most commonly-asked questions about the frogs.<br />Besides learning about the frogs and observing them, our students also got the opportunity to experience a hands-on session! The frog farm guide patiently guided our students on how to handle the frog appropriately and with care. It was many of our students&rsquo; first time seeing and touching a live frog. It was indeed an experience of a lifetime!</p>

<p>We hope that through this engaging and memorable experience, our students have gained a deeper understanding of the frogs and the disappearing farm scene of Singapore. We also hope that they will be inspired to do their part to protect the natural habitat and species in Singapore!&nbsp;</p>

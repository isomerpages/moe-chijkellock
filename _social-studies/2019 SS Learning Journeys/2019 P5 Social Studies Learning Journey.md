<h4><strong>Primary 5 Indian Heritage Centre Learning Journey 2019</strong></h4>
<p>In CHIJ Kellock, we believe in learning beyond the classroom. As such, a learning journey to the Indian Heritage Centre (IHC) was organised for our Primary 5 students. The objectives of this learning journey are for our students to develop a keen interest in the heritage of Singapore and gain a better understanding and appreciation of the history and heritage of Indian communities in Singapore.The IHC traces the history of Indian and South Asian communities in Singapore and the South Asia region. Students can see the information on their Social Studies textbook about ancient civilisations, influences of India and its impact on Singapore come alive through this unforgettable experience in IHC.</p>

<p>Before our students started on the tour, each of them received a Discovery Kit from their IHC docent guide. This Discovery Kit helps them to record their learning as they make their way around the centre. Our students&rsquo; experiences were made more meaningful with the help and explanation of experienced docents. These docents provided our students with information of the artefacts as well as the stories and experiences of early Indian migrants and pioneers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the experience at the various galleries, our students then visited the the museum shop and activity spaces in IHC. Our students experienced, explored and enjoyed the South Asian culture and heritage through traditional games such as Paramapadham (Snakes and Ladders), Pallanguzhi and Five Stones. Students tried their hands on designing their very own customised Five Stones pouch! These traditional games were an eye-opener for many of our students as they have not seen or enjoyed them before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope that through this experience, our students have gained a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Indian culture. We also hope that they will be inspired by the contributions of the early Indian migrants and pioneers towards the development of present day Singapore and do their part for Singapore one day!</p>

<p>On 14 March 2019, our Primary 2 students took a learning journey to the nearby Bukit Purmei neighbourhood by foot. This learning journey has provided the opportunity for enriching and extending learning beyond the classroom and school compound. It has also provided the opportunity for our students to experience, understand and appreciate their surroundings. By relating what they have learnt in the classrooms to the real world, our students were able to broaden and deepen their understanding of the various subjects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the walk, our students were introduced to the various trades and stores and present in the neighbourhood. Some examples are a dental clinic, a laundromat, an optical shop, a traditional bakery and a convenience store. In addition, students also learnt about the proper names of people who work in these trades and stores. They even got to see some of them in action! Students also applied their knowledge of prepositions by answering questions based on the locations of various trades and stores.</p>

<p>While walking through the HDB void decks, students also got the opportunity to learn about important signage and functions (e.g. letterboxes and AED device). It is important for our students to learn about these signage so that they will be socially aware about their personal safety and the safety of others on top of being able to navigate around the neighbourhood with success. Knowledge of these signage help our students to be aware of the Dos and Don&rsquo;ts in the neighbourhood and be gracious and responsible citizens of their neighbourhood. By experiencing the neighbourhood walk together, it provides a shared experience for our students to discuss about, reflect on and share their opinions with their classmates, parents and teachers after the learning journey. We look forward to the next learning journey in 2020!</p>

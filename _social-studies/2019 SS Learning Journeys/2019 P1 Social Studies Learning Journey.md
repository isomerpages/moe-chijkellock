<h4><strong>Primary 1 School Trail Social Studies Learning Journey</strong></h4>
<p>At the beginning of a new year, our new Primary 1 students embarked on an exciting trail around the school. As part of the school&rsquo;s Social Studies curriculum, the trail is specially designed for our new students to get familiarised with the important places, facilities and various learning rooms around the school. This allows them to be aware of the locations and functions of these places. The students followed their Social Studies around the school and took notes while they were doing so. As part of the learning experience, students were encouraged to discuss and speak to their friends about their experience.</p>

<p>During the trail, students wrote down some notes that will be used for their post-trail discussions. Students also wrote about their favourite place in school and provided reasons for their choice. Students then shared their writings and drawings with their classmates. Discussions are essential as they encourage the development of social skills such as active listening, recognizing others&rsquo; point-of-view, turn-taking and effective communication</p>

<p>Our students enjoyed themselves tremendously and we believe that what they have learnt will be useful for the rest of their years in CHIJ Kellock. We look forward to bringing our next group of Primary 1 students on the next school trail in 2020!</p>

<h4><strong>Primary 6 Sungei Buloh Social Studies Learning Journey</strong></h4>
<p>As part of our school&rsquo;s interdisciplinary learning journey programmes, a Social Studies cum Science Learning Journey to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve was organised for our Primary 6 students. The future of our planet depends on our children and it is important that they are given the opportunity to learn to appreciate and experience nature in a safe and educational environment. Through this learning journey, our students were introduced to the characterisitcs and adaptations of the various species of flora and fauna in a natural mangrove environment. This encourages our students to develop an appreciation towards nature and in turn, understand the importance of preserving the natural heritage of Singapore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before the trip, our students were briefed on the importance of the proper etiquette and behaviour &ndash; no touching of animals, no littering and no plucking of flora and fauna. Students were also provided with a folder each. The folder contains activity sheets that will facilitate the students&rsquo; learning throughout the journey.</p>

<p>This invaluable learning journey had provided the opportunity for our students to engage with nature in our homeland. We hope that through the various learning experiences brought about by this learning journey, our students have developed not only factual knowledge, but also an intimate understanding and appreciation towards the caring and sustaining of Mother Nature.&nbsp;</p>

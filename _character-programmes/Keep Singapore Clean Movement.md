<h4><strong>Keep Singapore Clean Movement &ndash; Kellock Cleaning Routines</strong></h4>
<p>In CHIJ (Kellock), students take ownership of the cleanliness of the school. Through the cleaning movements in school, we aimed to nurture students as concerned citizens who has a strong sense of civic responsibility and actively contributing to the community. This is achieved through the following programmes:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Kellock Spring-Cleaning with Customised Teaching Package&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Through the customised termly spring cleaning teaching package, students were inform of the latest news around the world, such as various ways to keep the environment clean, as well as raising their awareness on environmental issues in Singapore and around the world.</p>
<p>During spring cleaning, students take responsibility of their cleaning duties and worked collaboratively with their peers to achieve a common goal, which is to keep our new upgraded school campus clean. Students learnt to appreciate and be grateful for the conducive school environment in the process and carried out their cleaning duties with pride. Students also helped and encouraged one another during the cleaning activities and had fun time cleaning the school with their peers.</p>

<li><strong>Kellock 5 Minutes Daily Cleaning Routine</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The &ldquo;Kellock 5 Minutes Daily Cleaning Routine&rdquo; is a daily cleaning routine performed by all students during the last 5 minutes of every school day, with classical music being played. During the cleaning routine, students perform duties according to the duty roster, such as up keeping the notice board, cleaning the white board, sweeping the floor, picking the litter, arranging the books under table as well as arranging tables and chairs.</p>
<p>Through the &ldquo;Kellock 5 Minutes Daily Cleaning Routine&rdquo;, students cultivate good habits in keeping the cleanliness of their classroom, as well as sense of responsibility and good cleaning habits. During the cleaning routine each day, students also learn how to show love and care towards their peers as they keep their classroom clean for everyone in class.</p>

<li><strong>Kellock Canteen Keepers</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from students maintaining the cleanliness of their classrooms, classes also take turns to manage the cleanliness of the canteen, through the concept of &ldquo;Kellock Canteen Keepers&rdquo; Students work together as a class to clean the canteen after recess. Students are assigned duties such as picking of litter, clearing of plates and cups, sweeping of floor and wiping of canteen tables.</p>
<p>Through the &ldquo;Kellock Canteen Keepers&rdquo; programme, students learnt to be responsible for the cleanliness of their school canteen. As the school canteen is a public space used by all students, keeping the school canteen clean shows that our students care for the school environment.</p>

<li><strong>4) Kellock Green Captains</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In CHIJ Kellock, we have our very own Kellock Green Captains, being the advocates of a clean and green school environment. Kellock Green Captains oversee the above mentioned cleaning programmes: End-of-Term Spring Cleaning, End-of-Day Cleaning Routine and Canteen Keepers. During Spring Cleaning, our Green Captains ensure that everyone does their part in cleaning; During End-of-Day Cleaning Routine, when music comes on, Green Captains will go to the front of the classroom and get classmates to start cleaning. After the cleaning routine each day, they would use rubrics to determine the cleanliness of the classroom; During Canteen Keepers duty, Green Captains ensures that everyone does their part in cleaning.</p>
<p>Apart from overseeing the cleaning programmes, Kellock Green Captains also play their part in energy conservation efforts, such as saving electricity and water in classroom and toilets. They also raise awareness on keeping the school clean, by designing posters to encourage proper usage of toilets and keeping the toilets clean, contributing to the cleanliness efforts in school.</p>
<p>In November 2019, Kellock Green Captains attended a workshop conducted by Zero Waste SG, learning how to make sustainable and eco-friendly cleaners that can be used both in school for spring cleaning as well as at home. Through this workshop, our Green Captains learnt on how eco-friendly cleaners are beneficial to the environment and why they should be used for cleaning purposes. This is also part of their training, where the school seeks to extend their learning to help raise their awareness on environmental issues.</p>

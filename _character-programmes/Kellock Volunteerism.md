<p>In CHIJ Kellock, we believe that all our students can make a difference by taking a step forward to volunteer to help others in need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the true spirit of volunteerism, we encourage our students to take the initiative to help others, putting in time and effort for a good cause. Thus, Kellock volunteerism platforms provide the avenue for our students to show care for others on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>CCE lessons focused on the explicit teaching of values, knowledge and skills, to develop our students to be citizens of good character. CCE lessons in the primary levels are taught in Mother Tongue Languages. For students who offer the Non-Tamil Indian Languages (NTIL), namely Bengali, Punjabi and Urdu as their Mother Tongue and for those who are exempted from taking MTL, CCE will be taught in English. Instructional materials will also be in English.</p>

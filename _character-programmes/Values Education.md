<p>The values and attitudes we live by affect how we relate to people in our everyday lives. &ldquo;We need personal values to enable each of us to have the confidence and self-awareness and the grit and determination to succeed.&rdquo; (Minister Heng, 2011) Hence, our school has embarked on the Values Education programme for all Primary 1 to Primary 6 students.</p>
<p>Using the three &ldquo;I Will&rdquo; statements of the school values as lesson titles, the Values Education programme makes use of real stories, songs, videos to educate our students on the six school values.&nbsp;</p>

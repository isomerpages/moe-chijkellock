<p>Form Teacher&rsquo;s Guidance Period also known as FTGP is implemented within the school curriculum time for all classes by the form and co-form teachers. Research has shown that students are more likely to be emotionally and intellectually invested in classes where they have positive relationships with their teachers (Nichols, 2006, Pianta, 1999 &amp; Phelan, 1992)</p>
<p>During FTGP, purposeful student-teacher interactions and the explicit teaching of Social Emotional competencies take place. Students acquire skills that will help them in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better understand themselves (self awareness)</li>
<li>Better manage themselves (self management)</li>
<li>Better understand their family and friends (social awareness)</li>
<li>Better understand ways to work with their family and friends (relationship management)</li>
<li>Better their decision-making skills (responsible decision making)</li>
</ul>

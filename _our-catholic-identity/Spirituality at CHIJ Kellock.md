<p align="center">“For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith – and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of the God.” 
<b>Ephesians 2:8</b></p>
<br>
Faith is at the heart of a Catholic education. Faith formation is more than learning from a book. It is learning to live the faith each day. At CHIJ Kellock, the Catholic parents of the school entrust their children to our care and together, we take shared responsibility for the faith formation of the children, our students. Faith formation at CHIJ Kellock gives students an opportunity to know and experience God’s love, to walk their journey of faith with their friends and teachers, and to become faith-filled children of God. 
<br>
<h4> Catholic Identity </h4><br >
CHIJ Kellock is a faith-based community where belief in God is part of our daily activities. Students participate in the sacraments of the Eucharist and Confession, Paraliturgical services, rosary devotions, liturgical seasons of Lent and Easter as well as prayer that marks the significant moments of the day. 
<br>
<h4>Religious Instruction</h4><br >
The Catholic girls in the school are guided by Catechists from among teachers and friends of the school who are committed to the faith development of the children through weekly Catechism lessons where Bible stories come alive and where they learn what it means to walk in the light of Christ.
<br>
<h4>Servant Leadership</h4><br >
The vision of CHIJ Kellock to nurture discipleship among the students is a call to serve with humility and love. Servant leadership in the school is anchored on the words of our Founder, Blessed Nicolas Barré that “the Gifts given to you are for others”. Our children bring their gifts of music, oratorical skills and others through their service as student lectors, class prayer leaders and members of the music ministry. 
<br>
<h4>Chaplaincy</h4><br >
At CHIJ Kellock, we believe that it takes a village to raise a child. The Chaplaincy Team of the school comprising our Chaplain from Church of St Teresa, parents and friends of the school, teachers and school leaders, work in tandem to build the foundation for the faith development of the children in school. This partnership gives students a chance to understand the mission, beliefs and practices of their faith. Formed in the faith, our children will boldly go into a world that needs them and make a difference.<br>

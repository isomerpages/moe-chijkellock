<p>This year, our Malay Department team has put up decorations and an information board on Hari Raya celebrations which focus on our Malay traditional costumes, food and delicacies during the Hari Raya festival. We displayed some samples&nbsp;of baju kurung and baju kebaya, which are the traditional dresses of Malay ladies, at the booth. Our students also had the opportunity to attempt the &lsquo;Let's Celebrate Hari Raya at Kellock&rsquo; quiz on the SLS online platform and win tokens for themselves. They have written greeting cards to their Muslim friends who celebrate Hari Raya too</p>

<h4><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight 2022</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Bahasa Melayu (Primary 1- 6)<br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;Bahasa Mencerminkan Budaya, Budaya Melambangkan Nilai&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Language Unlocks Culture, Culture Reflects Values</strong></p>
<p>This year, the Mother Tongue Fortnight event was conducted from 18th to 31st January 2022. The theme for this year is &lsquo;Language Unlocks Culture, Culture Reflects Values&rsquo;, which focuses on customs and festivals. This is also in line with our objective of having more cultural activities in the context of an IJ school. Therefore, for this year, our Primary 1 to Primary 6 Malay students participated in a variety of cultural activities.</p>
<p>Our Primary 1 and 2 students were involved in a Malay Drama. They were exposed to reading dialogues with various expressions. Students truly enjoyed this session as they got the chance to do role plays. Our Primary 3 students did storytelling sessions in class, in which they have chosen stories which are related to the CCE values. Our Primary 4 students were involved in Malay Cultural Camp this year. During the entire camp, they were exposed to mainly four different main activities which consisted of kite-making, also known as Wau, they learned to play the angklung instrument, they did storytelling and last but not least, the making of bunga manggar. Our Primary 5 students did values-based skit performance in class. They prepared their own set of scripts and acted out the different scenarios in front of their peers. In addition, our P3 and P5 students had the opportunity to participate in an &lsquo;Aksyen&rsquo; drama workshop. In this workshop, we hope that our students would develop the love of the Malay Language through understanding of the principles of performance art. They would be able to enrich their Malay Language vocabulary by learning some of the terms used in the workshop as they speak the Malay Language confidently among their peers. Our Primary 6 students had taken up a challenging task to prepare a 3-minute Malay speech in class, which was based on values that they have learnt too.</p>
<p>All Malay students were highly encouraged to read different types of books to complete the Bingo Reading Card activity. Students were brought to the school library and teachers have read out stories to them. Through these reading activities, students were exposed to many different genres and types of reading materials. They enjoyed reading short stories and song lyrics, listening to pre-recorded fables, story- telling sessions by their Rakan Bahasa and not forgetting, their non-Malay teachers!</p>

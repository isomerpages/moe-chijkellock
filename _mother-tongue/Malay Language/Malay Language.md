Hari Raya Aidil Fitri is a celebration of victory in completing the fast and the overcoming of personal struggles during the Ramadhan, as well as a time of forgiveness and strengthening of bonds amongst family members.</p></td>

<p>This year, our Malay Department team has put up decorations and an information board on Hari Raya celebrations which focus on our Malay traditional costumes, food and delicacies during the Hari Raya festival. We displayed some samples&nbsp;of baju kurung and baju kebaya, which are the traditional dresses of Malay ladies, at the booth. Our students also had the opportunity to attempt the &lsquo;Let's Celebrate Hari Raya at Kellock&rsquo; quiz on the SLS online platform and win tokens for themselves. They have written greeting cards to their Muslim friends who celebrate Hari Raya too</p>

<h4><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight
</strong></h4>
<p>Mother Tongue Fortnight was mooted in 2012 by MOE to encourage the use of Mother Tongue languages among students. This year, Mother Fortnight was conducted from 9 to 20 January. The theme is <b><i>Language Unlocks Culture, Culture Reflects Values</i></b>, which focuses on traditional food. This is also in line with our objective of having more cultural activities in the context of an IJ school.</p>
<p>During Mother Tongue Fortnight this year, the Mother Tongue Department had set up various culture experiential stations and photo booth for students to visit during recess. Students gained hands-on experience on Chinese calligraphy and mooncake making. Traditional food from different races were displayed and introduced to students as well. Many students participated in the follow up quiz and lucky draw.</p>
<p>Lower primary students had the opportunity to watch and appreciate the Chinese drama (狐假虎威和持竿进城) performed by Arts Theatre of Singapore Ltd. Mr Josef Lee, who is a Singaporean picture-book writer-artist, was invited to conduct a guided-reading session of his picture book 《 我的守护熊2- 真正的超级英雄》(《Bear With Me 2 – The Real Superhero》 ) for our Primary 3 students. The book uses vivid and heartwarming illustrations with simple words and an easy-to-understand storyline to guide our students on the topic of "bullying". Throughout the guided-reading session, students were truly engaged, and they participated actively in the quizzes and drawing activity.</p>
<p>Like previous years, a camp was organised for all P4 students to provide them with an immersive environment to learn about the use of Mother Tongue Languages (MTL), and to appreciate the respective MTL cultures through hands-on tasks. Our P4 students were charmed by the energetic stage performances like Wushu, Dikir Barat and Indian Dance. They also got to try their hands on a variety of classroom activities, such as designing their own creative food clay art, recitation using bamboo clappers, Speech and Drama, learning of Chinese Idioms, and many more. The p4 girls not only learnt about their cultural heritage, but also forged a strong sense of identity to their Mother Tongue and joyful memories with their friends.</p>
<p>During Mother-Tongue Fortnight, our P5 students learnt how to draw comics strips related to Chinese idioms (成语）. The programme started off with interesting stories of Chinese idioms. After that, the students were given the opportunity to draw comics strips with stories that bring out the meaning of these idioms. 

Finally, we invited Dr. Liang Wern Fook (梁文福) to conduct Xin Yao (Singapore Chinese Folk Songs) Workshop for our P6 students. Dr. Liang is a Cantonese Singaporean writer, musician, singer and researcher in Chinese literature and pedagogy. He was one of the pioneer figures in Xin Yao movement in the 1980s and 1990s. Dr. Liang’s unique experience inspired students to recognize their own strength, treasure their culture heritage as well as the Singapore identity.</p>

<h4><strong>Fourth Singapore Textbook Recital Competition (Primary and Secondary)</strong></h4>
<p>This year, four groups of students from CHIJ Kellock participated in the Fourth Singapore Textbook Recital Competition (Primary and Secondary) which was organized by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning. The competition aims to deepen students&rsquo; understanding towards textbook articles through recital, as well as raise students&rsquo; interest towards Chinese Language through exploring the art of recital.</p>
<p>The students attended a few coaching sessions conducted by the teachers-in-charge and proceeded with the videoing sessions. The video productions were then sent to the organizer for judging. Two groups of P3 and one group of P6 students won Bronze in preliminary round and one group of P6 students won Silver in Preliminary round.</p>

<h4><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight</strong></h4>
<p>Mother Tongue Fortnight was mooted in 2012 by MOE to encourage the use of Mother Tongue languages among students. This year, Mother Fortnight was conducted from 18 to 31 January. The theme this year is&nbsp;<strong><em>Language Unlocks Culture, Culture Reflects Values</em></strong>, which focuses on customs and festivals. This is also in line with our objective of having more cultural activities in the context of an IJ school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arts Theatre of Singapore Ltd was engaged to perform a Chinese children&rsquo;s drama &ldquo;The Story of Nian&rdquo;. The recorded performance was then shown to our Primary 1 and 2 students so that they know how Chinese New Year came about. A famous poem related to the Qing Ming Festival was taught to our P3 students. They were also given lessons on round fan painting, where they brought back their self-painted round fans home as a souvenir. For the P5 students, a workshop on the origins of the Dragon Boat Festival was conducted. They were also taught to draw out the story of patriotic poet Qu Yuan in a comic book art style. As for our P6 students, a workshop on the Dragon Boat Festival culture learning was also conducted. Additionally, they also learnt to make traditional sachets which they could bring home as souvenir.</p>
<p>Like previous years, a camp was organised for all P4 students to provide them with an immersive environment to learn about the use of Mother Tongue Languages (MTL), and to appreciate the respective MTL cultures through hands-on tasks. To align with the focus on customs and festivals, one of the activities was related to Chongyang Festival.</p>
<p>Starting from last year, the Mother Tongue department has incorporated&nbsp;<strong>Reading for Life</strong>&nbsp;as one of the sub-themes for Mother Tongue Fortnight as we view reading as an important platform to enhance our students&rsquo; language proficiency. We have officially appointed CL/TL/ML ambassadors as functional student leadership roles. One of their roles is to promote new books to the girls in class. To reinforce the reading of MT books on Tuesday and Thursday morning under the DEAR programme, we have created posters for the reading programme to promote reading and remind students to read MT books on Tuesday and Thursday. EL-medium teachers were invited to tell MT stories to our girls to inspire them to read MT books. This year, our Vice-principal Mrs Chan was als involved in reading CL stories to our P2 girls. An online book fair was also held so that the students had the opportunity to buy reading and enrichment materials to facilitate their learning of the Mother Tongue languages.</p>
<p>This year, we had a special treat for our CL campus reporters and P5 HCL girls. We invited Mr Lip Kwok Wai 聂国威from Mediacorp to conduct &ldquo;Meet the Chinese Newscaster&rdquo; workshop (Online) as part of the &ldquo;Mother Tongue Fortnight&rdquo; programme. During this workshop, Mr Lip shared his own experience in learning Chinese, as well as his journey to become a reporter. He also shared tips on how to conduct a good interview and broadcast news. Students were also given an inside glimpse on what goes behind the scenes of news broadcasting.</p>

<h4><strong>Chinese New Year (CNY) Celebration</strong></h4>
<p>CHIJ Kellock celebrated Chinese New Year (CNY) on Monday, 31 January. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation, this was the second year that the school organised a virtual concert instead of a live concert in the school hall. We started the celebration with an opening video to usher in the year of the Tiger. The acts in the video were performed by our supportive and talented school leaders, who were resilient and determined to fight against the corona virus to protect our girls in Kellock. Although there was no lion or dragon dance performances unlike pre-pandemic times, the girls learnt the significance of dragon dance as an important cultural activity of CNY. From the video, the girls were also exposed to the different kinds of dragon dance performances, such as dragon dance at night, dragon dance under water etc.</p>
<p>To give our girls some &ldquo;off-screen&rdquo; time, the teachers got the girls to do some CNY crafts. The lower primary girls were given different drawing templates to colour while the upper primary girls were given red paper to do paper cutting. They had to cut out the image of a tiger, the Chinese characters 春and福 respectively for P4, P5 and P6. The final art pieces could be used as a decoration for home or in school. After the hands-on session, the girls were treated to a virtual String Ensemble performance by our own Kellock girls. The highlight of the CNY virtual concert was our girls&rsquo; voluntary participation performances that they recorded at home. The response received from our girls as well as the support from their parents was overwhelming, as Kellock parents are known to be supportive of our school programmes and their children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>Another interesting programme was &ldquo;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&rdquo; (卧虎藏龙) which required the girls to guess who the teacher voice-over actress was for various movie characters such as &lsquo;Flash&rsquo;, &lsquo;Po&rsquo;, &lsquo;Mushu&rsquo;, &lsquo;Patrick Star&rsquo;, &lsquo;Shoyo Hinata&rsquo;, &lsquo;Howler&rsquo; as well as the narrator for a BBC documentary. This programme brought the celebration to another climax when answers to the teacher voice-over actresses were revealed. The excitement exhibited by the girls were followed by another &ldquo;off-screen&rdquo; time, where students got to play a game with their own group members. Towards the end of the celebration, all the girls participated in a dance along session with CNY music videos playing in the background. Although they were not able to sing along due to the safe management measures that were put in place, they still enjoyed themselves with this little treat from the teachers.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we can hold another live concert in the school hall again next year!</p>

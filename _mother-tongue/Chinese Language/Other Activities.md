<h4><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight
</strong></h4>
<p>Mother Tongue Fortnight was mooted in 2012 by MOE to encourage the use of Mother Tongue languages among students. This year, Mother Fortnight was conducted from 9 to 20 January. The theme is <b><i>Language Unlocks Culture, Culture Reflects Values</i></b>, which focuses on traditional food. This is also in line with our objective of having more cultural activities in the context of an IJ school.</p>
<p>During Mother Tongue Fortnight this year, the Mother Tongue Department had set up various culture experiential stations and photo booth for students to visit during recess. Students gained hands-on experience on Chinese calligraphy and mooncake making. Traditional food from different races were displayed and introduced to students as well. Many students participated in the follow up quiz and lucky draw.</p>
<p>Lower primary students had the opportunity to watch and appreciate the Chinese drama (狐假虎威和持竿进城) performed by Arts Theatre of Singapore Ltd. Mr Josef Lee, who is a Singaporean picture-book writer-artist, was invited to conduct a guided-reading session of his picture book 《 我的守护熊2- 真正的超级英雄》(《Bear With Me 2 – The Real Superhero》 ) for our Primary 3 students. The book uses vivid and heartwarming illustrations with simple words and an easy-to-understand storyline to guide our students on the topic of "bullying". Throughout the guided-reading session, students were truly engaged, and they participated actively in the quizzes and drawing activity.</p>
<p>Like previous years, a camp was organised for all P4 students to provide them with an immersive environment to learn about the use of Mother Tongue Languages (MTL), and to appreciate the respective MTL cultures through hands-on tasks. Our P4 students were charmed by the energetic stage performances like Wushu, Dikir Barat and Indian Dance. They also got to try their hands on a variety of classroom activities, such as designing their own creative food clay art, recitation using bamboo clappers, Speech and Drama, learning of Chinese Idioms, and many more. The p4 girls not only learnt about their cultural heritage, but also forged a strong sense of identity to their Mother Tongue and joyful memories with their friends.</p>
<p>During Mother-Tongue Fortnight, our P5 students learnt how to draw comics strips related to Chinese idioms (成语）. The programme started off with interesting stories of Chinese idioms. After that, the students were given the opportunity to draw comics strips with stories that bring out the meaning of these idioms. 

Finally, we invited Dr. Liang Wern Fook (梁文福) to conduct Xin Yao (Singapore Chinese Folk Songs) Workshop for our P6 students. Dr. Liang is a Cantonese Singaporean writer, musician, singer and researcher in Chinese literature and pedagogy. He was one of the pioneer figures in Xin Yao movement in the 1980s and 1990s. Dr. Liang’s unique experience inspired students to recognize their own strength, treasure their culture heritage as well as the Singapore identity.</p>

<h4><strong>Chinese New Year (CNY) Celebration
</strong></h4>
<p>CHIJ Kellock held the Chinese New Year celebration to usher in the year of Rabbit on Friday, 20 January 2023. In the past two years, the Chinese New Year celebration was held virtually due to COVID-19. This year, we can finally celebrate Chinese New Year through a live concert held in the school hall. We started the celebration with a mini skit inspired by Zootopia. Judy the rabbit, who was acted by a teacher, had a conversation with Flash the sloth in the video to ask about the Chinese New Year celebration. Judy then invited the School Leaders to launch the celebration. The Lion Dance live show kick-started the subsequent performances and blessed the whole school with good luck in the year 2023.</p>
<p>CCA performances by String Ensemble and Rhythmic Gymnastics brought the celebration to its first climax. Students’ individual and group performances were another highlight of the program. Shannon Teo from P5 Jupiter performed a solo dance while singing “He Xin Nian” (《贺新年》). The P2 girls showcased interesting magic show videos. Two pairs of sisters and their friend performed the English version of the traditional Chinese song “Da Di Hui Chun” (《大地回春》). Special thanks to supportive parent, Sarah’s mother for her creative translation. Another parent who joined us in this celebration was Emily Too’s father, who put up a parent-child performance together with Emily on the modern Chinese song “Ni Xiao Qi Lai Zhen Hao Kan” (《你笑起来真好看》).</p>
<p>To engage students, level games were designed at different points throughout the celebration. Students from different levels were invited to participate in games such as “Who is this teacher”, “Spot the difference” and “Guess the Chinese Zodiac”. Winners from all levels were rewarded with a small present.</p>
<p>During the CNY celebration, P3 and P4 girls from different races performed a medley with songs inspired by traditional food from different cultures, which they learnt During the Mother Tongue Fortnight this year. Another interesting program that exhibited racial harmony was an Indian dance performance by Mrs Geetha, accompanied by a background song sung by Chinese singer Zhou Shen. Mrs Geetha’s unique performance brought the celebration to another climax. Other teachers’ performances including “Chun Lian Hong” (《春联红》) and “Friend” (《朋友》) were also well received. To give students a break, teachers led workout session was carried out halfway through the celebration. Students enjoyed themselves as they danced along to the music. 

As a symbol of prosperity, mandarin oranges were given to the teachers by the School Leaders at the end of celebration.</p>
<p>We wish everyone in Kellock family abundance, health, and happiness in the year of Rabbit!</p>

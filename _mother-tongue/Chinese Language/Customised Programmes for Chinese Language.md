<h4><strong>Four-Tier Composition Writing&rsquo; Programme for P5 and P6</strong></h4>
<p>Four-Tier Composition Writing&rsquo; Programme is another stretch programme designed by the CL department to raise the writing standard of our Primary 5 and Primary 6 students who study Higher Chinese. The content is based on the two types of writing format of HCL examination. Through scaffolding, the programme aims to train students&rsquo; critical and creative thinking skills. Students&rsquo; interactive skills are also enhanced through Cooperative Learning strategies. Besides teachers&rsquo; evaluation, self-evaluation, peer evaluation and parents&rsquo; feedback or encouragement are incorporated to enhance students&rsquo; writing skills. Based on these evaluation/feedback/encouragement, students revise their writing until they are able to produce a high quality piece of work to the best of their ability.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Approach</u></strong></p>
<p>A modular approach is adopted for the teaching of Chinese Language in primary schools. This differentiated approach aims to bring greater customisation and flexibility in the teaching of Chinese Language.</p>
<p>For the majority of the students, they will only take the core module which constitutes 70-80% of CL curriculum time. For students who enter school with little or no CL exposure, they will first take the Bridging Module which constitutes 20 to 30% CL curriculum time before they move on to the Core module. This is to provide additional support and a friendly start.</p>
<p>For those with interest and ability, the modular curriculum also has the added advantage of allowing them to go further by taking the Enrichment module after the Core Module. For the group of students taking only the Core Module, a corresponding school-based curriculum will be developed to match 20-30% of curriculum time.</p>

<h4><strong>NE Ambassadors 2018</strong></h4><p>The appointment of NE Ambassadors recognises students with leadership qualities and their ability to serve at the school level. NE Ambassadors promote citizenship values in school and they are positive roles models of young citizens. They also plan and organise activities for NE commemorative days and share contemporary news with school at a regular interval.</p><p><strong><u>NE Commemorative Days</u></strong></p><p>The NE Ambassadors were involved in planning and organising activities for the following 4 NE commemorative days, i.e. Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day.</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Total Defence Day:</strong></p></li></ul><p>A variety of learning booths were set up by the NE Ambassadors to educate students on the 5 pillars of Total Defence and simple first aid skills. They made the booths interactive by including games for the Lower Primary students and a mini quiz for the Upper Primary students. They also demonstrated simple bandaging skills like the head bandage and arm sling. They provided hands-on opportunities for the students to try out these basic first-aid skills. On top of these, they encouraged the students to make a pledge to protect Singapore at the pledge card booths.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ne1.jpg"></div><p>Matching game for the Lower Primary students</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ne2.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ne3.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Mini quiz for the Upper Primary students to solve</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ne4.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ne5.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>NE ambassadors demonstrating simple bandaging skills like head bandage and arm sling.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ne6.jpg"></div><p>Students learning about what goes inside a first-aid kit.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ne7.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ne8.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>NE Ambassadors encouraging students to write their pledge to protect Singapore at the pledge card booth</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>International Friendship Day</strong></p></li></ul><p>The NE Ambassadors assisted the Kellock Parent Support Group who organised the IFD carnival for the students.

They searched for relevant and age-appropriate topics to share. Apart from preparing the PowerPoint slides, they were also involved in the creation of videos which served as a tuning in for the topic. Although most of them had to step out of their comfort zone to perform in front of a camera, they took it in their stride and put in their best effort during the recordings. The sharing has been well-received by the students and teachers. The following are the topics on the contemporary news that have been shared thus far:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Climate Change</p></li><li><p>Fake News</p></li><li><p>Road Safety</p></li><li><p>Fighting Diabetes</p></li><li><p>Cyberbullying</p></li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ne24.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ne25.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Sharing on Climate Change</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ne26.png"></div><p>Sharing on Fake News</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ne27.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ne28.png"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Sharing on Road Safety</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ne29.png"></div><p>Sharing on Fighting Diabetes</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ne30.png"></div><p>Sharing on Cyberbullying</p><p><strong><u>Leadership Camp in June</u></strong></p><p>During the June holidays, the NE Ambassadors together with other student leaders, participated in the annual leadership camp.

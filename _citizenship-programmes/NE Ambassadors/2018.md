<h4><strong>NE Ambassadors 2018</strong></h4>
<p>The appointment of NE Ambassadors recognises students with leadership qualities and their ability to serve at the school level. NE Ambassadors promote citizenship values in school and they are positive roles models of young citizens. They also plan and organise activities for NE commemorative days and share contemporary news with school at a regular interval.</p>
<p><strong><u>NE Commemorative Days</u></strong></p>
<p>The NE Ambassadors were involved in planning and organising activities for the following 4 NE commemorative days, i.e. Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Defence Day:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A variety of learning booths were set up by the NE Ambassadors to educate students on the 5 pillars of Total Defence and simple first aid skills. They made the booths interactive by including games for the Lower Primary students and a mini quiz for the Upper Primary students. They also demonstrated simple bandaging skills like the head bandage and arm sling. They provided hands-on opportunities for the students to try out these basic first-aid skills. On top of these, they encouraged the students to make a pledge to protect Singapore at the pledge card booths.</p>

<p>The NE Ambassadors assisted the Kellock Parent Support Group who organised the IFD carnival for the students.

<p>To educate the students on the games played by the different ethnic groups, the NE Ambassadors set up a wide range of game booths on Racial Harmony Day. The games included 5 stones, chapteh, pickup sticks, zero point, eraser game, Dog and Bone and card games like Old Maid and Snap. The NE Ambassadors patiently explained the rules of the games to the students who visited the booths. The students were all engaged and they enjoyed themselves while playing the various games.</p>

<p>Prior to National Day, the NE Ambassadors set up booths for students and teachers to write down gratitude messages for Singapore. They were enthusiastic and encouraged many students to write the reasons to why they were grateful towards Singapore. Being role models, they also set a good example by writing their messages of gratitude to Singapore.</p>

<p><u><strong>Sharing of Contemporary News</strong></u></p>
<p>The NE Ambassadors were tasked to share on contemporary news to the school this year. They searched for relevant and age-appropriate topics to share. Apart from preparing the PowerPoint slides, they were also involved in the creation of videos which served as a tuning in for the topic. Although most of them had to step out of their comfort zone to perform in front of a camera, they took it in their stride and put in their best effort during the recordings. The sharing has been well-received by the students and teachers. The following are the topics on the contemporary news that have been shared thus far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Climate Change</li>
<li>Fake News</li>
<li>Road Safety</li>
<li>Fighting Diabetes</li>
<li>Cyberbullying</li>
</ul>

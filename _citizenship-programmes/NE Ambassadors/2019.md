<h4><strong>Total Defence Day 2019</strong></h4><p>To commemorate Total Defence Day, a variety of learning booths were set up by the NE Ambassadors to educate students on the 5 pillars of Total Defence, as well as simple first aid skills for burns, insect bite and stings. Students were also taught how to call an ambulance during an emergency. At the pledge booths, students also contributed pledges on how they could play a part to keep Singapore strong. To consolidate what was learnt at the booths, the NE ambassadors facilitated first aid quizzes on an interactive platform via the ipad, for both the Lower Primary students as well as the Upper Primary students. Hands-on opportunities for the students to try out these basic first-aid skills were also provided. The response at the ipad booth was especially overwhelming as students had loads of fun while learning at the same time!&nbsp;</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="569" width="960" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSAncO2ZOq_WBxutnyxfCrhMAEv_5bxfM9JRzPx2HsGaPniWmt16rZJe6Z-AduIBZrFFbQrVZ40fIRo/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=10000"></iframe></div><p><strong>Videos:</strong></p><p><u>Term 1</u></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtzi4Rvux7Y&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Singapore's Bicentennial</a></p></li></ul><p><u>Term 2</u></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/7kksblv_XZU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Digital Defence - The 6th Pillar of the Total Defence</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/3wAyQBcmoaM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Earth Day</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/kE9XGFdDmho" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zero Waste</a></p></li></ul><p><u>Term 3</u></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/ywm0kD3D8WE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">E-Waste recycling in Singapore</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Yu79DKHabqM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Singapore Bicentennial Part 2 _Pioneers of the Bicentennial</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/7beL-Ynbwvc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Singapore Bicentennial Part 3 _Commemorative-note</a></p></li></ul><p><u>Term 4</u></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/brLBJPGuKwE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Haze</a></p></li></ul><p></p>

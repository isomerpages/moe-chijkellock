<p>At the heart of the Singapore Social Studies (SS) curriculum is the preparation of our students to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to better understand the interconnectedness in Singapore and the world they live in, and appreciate the complexities of the human experience. Drawing on the social life that is of meaning and interest to the learners, SS seeks to ignite students&rsquo; curiosity to inquire into real-world issues that concern their lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, SS helps students to attain relevant knowledge and understandings of these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives. SS seeks to inculcate in students a deeper understanding of the values that define the Singaporean society and nurture dispositions to show concern for the world they live in and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others. The curriculum therefore envisions the SS student as an informed, concerned and participative citizen who is competent in quality decision-making with an impassioned spirit to contribute responsibly in the world he/she lives in.</p>
<h4><strong>Social Studies Field Based Learning</strong></h4>
<p>Field-based learning allows students to contextualise their learning experience in an authentic real-world setting, thus enabling the relational learning of concepts and content. Students would also be able to conduct hands-on exploration in a focused area of study, thus being engaged in multi-sensory modes. As part of engaging students&rsquo; interest in inquiry, field-based learning would also motivate and sustain their interest in the subject matter as students would learn to explore, construct new knowledge and make connections to the topic being studied.</p>

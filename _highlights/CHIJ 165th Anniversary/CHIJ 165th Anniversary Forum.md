The presenters had shown us the true meaning of “seeking” and “serving”, highlighting key learning points such as responsibility, purpose, sacrifice, diligence, resilience, adaptability, love, compassion, empathy, humility, gratitude and integrity. During the “Question and Answer” segment, students were eagerly waiting in line to ask questions, while each presenter patiently and lovingly answered them all.</p><p>The morning provided everyone with insights to how the IJ Education had played a key role in the life journey of the presenters, and reinforced the values which the CHIJ Schools had inculcated in their students over the past 165 years. The forum enabled our current generation of students to witness, through the lives of our presenters, the success and continuing efforts of our CHIJ schools in developing young ladies to be “Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty”.</p><p>It was indeed a blessing for all present, to be able to witness the call of our Founder, Blessed Nicolas Barre, and the great work of our IJ Sisters in Singapore. As we celebrate the 165th Anniversary of the Founding of our IJ Mission in Singapore, may we maintain the bonds of our IJ friendships, and together, find time to always seek and serve, so as to keep the IJ spirit burning bright!</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="569" width="960" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTni4gRGol9X7COyG-gB9sROxml6PsITogVJXOBBa-0KSP1sK0Y6xRwalywfwBrLu8Z1kU91TlsIpkJ/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=10000"></iframe></div><p></p>

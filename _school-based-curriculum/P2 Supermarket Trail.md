<p>The Primary 2 students had gone on a learning journey to NTUC FairPrice at Bukit Merah Central for a Supermarket Trail.&nbsp; This learning journey has provided students with an authentic learning experience beyond the classroom and school. The students learnt about budgeting, comparing prices of the different items sold in the supermarket, studying the discounted and original prices of items and keeping track of the budget given to them. Together with the assistance from the Parent Volunteers, the students worked in groups to complete the activities given to them. It was indeed a rich and meaningful learning experience for the students.</p>

<p>The main aim of the Mathematics curriculum is to enable pupils to develop their ability in mathematical problem solving. Heuristics and thinking skills are problem solving strategies which help pupils in the process of solving Mathematics problems.</p>
<p>The programme,&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>roblem&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>olving&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>ackage (PSP), aims to equip pupils with various thinking skills and heuristics to help them solve mathematical problems. Each skill or heuristic is taught under a key concept or strategy. The programme is developmental in approach starting from Primary 1 level to Primary 6. Some of the thinking skills and problem solving heuristics are:</p>

<p>In equipping the pupils with problem solving in Mathematics, the school has adopted the Polya Model for Problem Solving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the acronym, UPER, we hope to scaffold pupils thinking process in their approach to problem solving.</p>

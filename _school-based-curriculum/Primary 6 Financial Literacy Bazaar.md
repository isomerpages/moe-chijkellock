<p>In collaboration with the Social Studies Department, the P6 students learn about social entrepreneurship. Students learn to develop a simple business plan for their social enterprise (bazaar stall), which includes budgeting, doing product surveys, as well as sale and marketing of their products. They learn about starting a small business to raise money for a good cause. Students become more environmentally aware by transforming recycled waste materials into a new or enhanced product through upcycling.</p>

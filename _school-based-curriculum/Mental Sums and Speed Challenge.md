<p>The development of skills and concepts are essential in the learning and application of Mathematics.</p>
<p>Speed Challenge aims to develop speed, accuracy and confidence in our students in recalling the basic concepts of the topics they are learning for the year. It involves skills and concepts such as number bonds, number notations, multiplication facts, use of formulae and conversion where only basic computation skills are needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speed Challenge is carried out across the level for Primary 1 to Primary 6 students.</p>

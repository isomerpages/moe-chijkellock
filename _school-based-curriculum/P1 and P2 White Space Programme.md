<p>We have two game-based programmes in Kellock for Primary 1 and 2, which provide an excellent vehicle to train the mind and to develop the capacity to think logically, abstractly, critically and creatively.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have Fun with Sudoku</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Sudoku is a game of logic, where one has to think strategically and solve problems creatively while spotting patterns. This &ldquo;brain game&rdquo; helps stimulate one&rsquo;s cognitive ability. By practising logical thinking as the puzzle is being solved, it helps students to improve number skills. It injects fun, and gives a sense of accomplishment when the puzzle is solved. The joy of learning comes from experiences of success.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Playing with Tangrams</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Tangrams is a traditional Chinese puzzle made up of a square divided into seven pieces (one parallelogram, one square and five triangles) that can be arranged to match particular designs. Playing tangrams helps to develop perceptual reasoning (nonverbal thinking skills), visual-spatial awareness, creativity and many mathematical concepts such as congruency, symmetry, area, perimeter, and geometry. Students get to explore playing tangrams hands-on, which makes learning fun and meaningful. Tangrams promotes open-ended explorations too. Thus teaching mathematics through tangrams encourages students to interact with mathematical concepts in a novel way, which deepens learning.</p>

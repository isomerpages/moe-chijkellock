Such learning experiences will enable students to discover that Mathematics is applicable in many aspects of their everyday activities and at the same time students would be able to make sense of what they learn.</p><p>‘Math Alive’ programme inculcates active learning on the part of the students. Through doing the various tasks, we hope to develop students’ appreciation of Mathematics and interest in the subject.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/matha.jpg"></div><p></p>

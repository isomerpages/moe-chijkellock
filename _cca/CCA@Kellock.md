<p><b><u>CCA POLICY </u></b><br>

CCAs are an integral part of the holistic education that contribute a great deal towards achieving the Kellock Girl Outcomes (KGOs). CCAs allow students to discover their interests and talents while developing character strengths through the variety of experience, enabling them to better adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing world.</p>

<p>At Kellock, all Primary 3 to Primary 6 students <b>MUST</b> participate in one school-based CCA. <br>
Attendance is <b>compulsory</b> at every CCA session. If a student is absent from CCA, her absence must be covered by a letter of excuse from the parents or a medical certificate.
</p>

<p>Students are expected to achieve a minimum of 80% of CCA attendance for the year.<br>
Students <b>are strongly encouraged to</b> stay in the same CCA till graduation at Primary 6. Any request for change of CCA is subject to approval on a case-by-case basis. The following documents need to be submitted to SH/PE & CCA for review: <br>
1)	Letter or Email request, together with a medical certificate stating the medical condition which hinders the continuation in the student’s current CCA. <br>
2)	Completed Request for Change of CCA Form (if request is approved)
</p>

<p><b><u>Sports Talent Development CCAs</u></b></p>

<p><b><u>P3 CCA Selection Exercise</u></b></p>


<p>At Primary 3, students who are not in a Talent Development CCA will participate in the CCA selection exercise in May. To help the students identify their area of interest/potential and for them to make informed decision together with their parents on which CCA to enroll in, the school conducts: </p>

<p><b><u> (1) P3 Sampler CCA</u></b><br>
                    This is an opportunity for students to try out recreational CCAs that are offered in the school.  <br>

 
<b><u> (2) P3 CCA Day </u></b><br>
                    CCA leaders from these recreational CCAs will be sharing their experiences of the respective CCAs with them. <br> 

Students <u>who are not in a Talent Development CCA </u>will participate in a CCA selection exercise. They are required to select their top 4 recreational CCA choices in order of preference. <br>

In the event that all 4 choices of CCA choices are oversubscribed, the school will inform parents so that parents can work with their child in selecting another CCA. </p>

<p>The SEC-Starhub School Green Awards (SGA) is a self-audited voluntary environmental programme which serves as a platform for students to develop and showcase their environmental efforts and gain a better understanding of the environment. CHIJ Kellock has attained the Vanda Miss Joaquim Award in 2018 and the Yellow Flame Award in 2019 to recognize the school's green efforts as well as community outreach by students to promote environmental conservation.</p>

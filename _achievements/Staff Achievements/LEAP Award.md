<p>The LEAP Award, which stands for “Listening Educator for Advancement and Progress Award”, was launched by the late former President S R Nathan in 2011 and awarded by Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan annually to recognise exceptional teachers who have made a positive impact in nurturing their students from the heart.The naming of the award signifies a leap of faith for a teacher to believe that students have the potential to excel beyond their capabilities.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Christina Tan&nbsp;<br>LEAP Award 2021</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>

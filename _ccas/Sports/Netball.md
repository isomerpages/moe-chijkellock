<p>Netball is a popular game in CHIJ (Kellock). During the CCA, students will acquire the basic knowledge, skills and attitudes in Netball. Through the comprehensive training programme put in place at every level, the CCA aims to develop students into thinking players who are anchored in the values.</p>
<p>To value-add students’ experience of school life and netball, the school has organised overseas Sports Immersion Trips where students learn about the history, tradition and culture of the country visited and reinforced their skills, knowledge and attitudes in netball through their training and friendly games organised. Local training camps are also organised to help students develop a better understanding of the game and improve their court performance.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights<br /></strong>Selected P3 to P6 students will be able to take part in age-group carnivals organized by Netball Singapore. P5 and P6 school team players will represent the school in the National School Games Netball Championships and other platforms to apply the skills, knowledge and attitudes acquired.</p>

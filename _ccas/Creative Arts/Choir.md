<p>The Choir inculcates discipline and builds confidence. It also develops students&rsquo; passion for singing and the performing arts through the 4-year choral programme. The 4-year choral programme will expose our students to a wide repertoire of choral music which will help them develop good singing techniques and habits. Students will be given opportunities to perform at school concerts, other important school events and external platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students may be called to attend extra practices in preparation for performances. These practices may take place during school holidays. For students to participate in various performances, they must have at least 85% attendance leading up to the respective performances and must be familiar with the performance repertoire. We will also conduct periodic assessment to help our students to be adequately prepared for performances. Our selection panel will carry out the assessment on a case-by-case basis and ensure that every rightful child is given an opportunity to excel in Choir.</p>

<p>Students participating in Dance Ensemble will train under the expertise of two qualified dance instructors. Through the 4-year CCA programme, students will be taught the Tap Dance and Jazz with focusing on barrework, footwork, posture awareness, jazz technique and alignment. Students will also get the opportunity to perform at school concerts and community events to showcase their skills learnt though choreographed dance items. Through the avenues of performances, students develop values responsibility, resilience and teamwork, and build their sense of self-confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Dance Ensemble represents the school at the biennial Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging (International Dance) and have been awarded with the distinction award each time, in recognition of their hard work, dance techniques and talent. The Dance Ensemble is an excellent avenue where young dancers come together to nurture their passion for dance, hone their dance skills and build friendship.</p>

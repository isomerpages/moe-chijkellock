<p>The Sewing Club aims to guide students to develop and master basic hand sewing skills within the 3 year duration of the course. Members will have opportunities to develop their creativity in using these skills through explorations of various mediums of sewing such as cross stitch, pattern making and other needlework varieties. Members of the club will have opportunities to improve their fine motor skills, and challenge themselves artistically to create their own designs from the skills taught.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights<br /></strong>Students will be exposed to the various tools and types of sewing as well as the history of these techniques. They would be taught the sewing and planning skills needed to facilitate in the creation of their own sewing pieces.

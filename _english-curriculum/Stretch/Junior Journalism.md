<h4><strong>Tell Your Story!</strong></h4><p>Tell Your Story is a journalism programme for budding reporters and journalists interested to learn how to produce reports, articles and videos on current affairs. Just like a reporter on the scene, students learn how to ask the correct questions, look for details and find a story in any situation. They learn to gather information effectively, organize ideas and edit articles. At the end of the programme, students would have developed a range of reporting and writing skills, developed critical thinking necessary to collect, evaluate, organise and disseminate news and published writing pieces on current affairs that report on authentic real-life situations in school and the community</p>

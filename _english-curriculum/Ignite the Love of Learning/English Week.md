<h4><strong>English Week: Good English &ndash; Any time, Any place, Anywhere!</strong></h4>
<p>Themed &lsquo;Good English! Anytime, anyplace, anywhere!&rsquo;, English Week aims to provide opportunities for students to develop themselves as confident speakers of the English Language. Aligned with the EL vision &lsquo;Communicators: Effective, Confident, Thoughtful&rsquo;, EL Week provides platforms and opportunities to cultivate the good habit of speaking proper English, in a thoughtful manner through a variety of activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve this, many interesting and meaningful activities such as assembly talks by authors, interesting story-telling sessions by professional story-tellers, Kellock&rsquo;s very own signature programme known as Speak Proper English At Kellock (SPEAK Award) Competition, and level-wide activities such as book caf&eacute;s and workshops tailored to suit the different age groups from Primary 1 to Primary 6 have been planned to encourage and motivate students to think, write, read and speak clearly and effectively. Let us take a look at how EL Week has been like over the years at Kellock!</p>

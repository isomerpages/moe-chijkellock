<p>Through the above approach, the English Department aims to equip students with a proficient command of the language by strengthening the foundation of the language and enriching the English Language curriculum through various platforms for language exposure. Such exposure will allow students ample opportunities to use the language in different contexts, revisit language structures and skills and see how language works according to purpose, audience, context and culture. As students progress through the six years at Kellock, they will learn to use English at increasing levels of difficulty and sophistication. </p>

<h4><strong>Our Mission</strong></h4>
<p>The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Department aims to foster a community of 21st century learners and critical thinkers who are confident speakers of their Mother Tongue Languages and appreciate its cultural values.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Vision</strong></h4>
<p>We aim to develop our students to become Â future-oriented learners who are able to communicate in their Mother Tongue language confidently, therefore enabling them to connect with others in using the language to learn about its cultural values.</p>
<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>Highlights</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Parents can help:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage your child to speak to family members in both Mother Tongue and English as learning of languages begins at home. Build her confidence in using Mother Tongue by not excessively correcting her mistakes.</li>
<li>Encourage your child to read good Mother Tongue and English books. To help your child to read in Mother Tongue, for a start you may want to get audio books or electronic books, or select books with attractive illustrations and relatively fewer words when she is younger. When she is more prepared and older, you can then choose books with more words.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Expose your child to good Mother Tongue and English programmes, for example, cartoons. This provides an alternative avenue for your child to be exposed to Mother Tongue. It would also be good to build up her language proficiency by allowing her to play meaningful games while using the language.</li>

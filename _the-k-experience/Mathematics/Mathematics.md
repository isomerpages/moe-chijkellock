<h4><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>Every Girl can Learn and Achieve in Mathematics given the right environment to stretch her potential.</p>
<p>Mathematical problem solving is central to mathematics learning. The importance given to problem solving in the mathematics curriculum mirrors the twenty-first century skills such as creative thinking, communication and problem solving skills which we would need to equip our girls with. The inherent &lsquo;spiral&rsquo; nature of mathematics curriculum will remain an important aspect of mathematics learning in developing our girls' problem solving abilities to become thoughtful learners.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>To develop a strong foundation in Mathematical concepts and skills, the school adopts the&nbsp;<strong>Concrete - Pictorial - Abstract</strong> approach in teaching and learning of Mathematics. This pedagogy enables gradual translation of concepts from actual objects to pictures and then to symbols. Ultimately, such experience helps to deepen conceptual understanding and retention.</li>
<li>To bring mathematics learning beyond the textbook and beyond the classroom, the school offers&nbsp;<strong>Authentic and Experiential Learning&nbsp;</strong>to all the girls. Such learning experience would allow the girls to apply and 'see the relevance of learning mathematics as well as make connections in what they are learning.</li>
<li>To provide opportunities for our girls to discover, reason and communicate mathematics, our teachers engage the girls through <strong>Cooperative and Independent Learning</strong>&nbsp;using various strategies and activities. Through such experiences and peer interaction, we hope to develop self-directed learners who are positively confident in mathematics learning.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Working Hand in Hand</strong></h4>
<p>To develop partnership with parents, the school actively involves parents through the different mathematics trails, activities and mathematics workshops. Parental involvement at home can play a vital role at all stages of their girls' learning.</p>
<p><strong>Parents can help your child at home by:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Practicing number bonds and multiplication tables frequently</li>
<li>Relating real-life experience to mathematical topics</li>
<ul>
<li>Money - Allowing students to use cash to pay for items and getting change</li>
<li>Time - Telling time from an analogue clock</li>
<li>Time - Duration (e.g. use a TV guide)</li>
<li>Measurement - provide opportunities for students to help out in the kitchen&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<li>Encouraging your child to do quick mental calculation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</h3>
<p align="justify">The ALP Programme at Kellock Connects classroom learning with <strong><u>real-life applications</u></strong> and encourages students to <strong><u>creatively apply concepts to solve authentic problems.</u></strong> It focuses on evoking curiosity in learning, developing inventive thinking and encouraging a dare-to-try spirit.</p>

<p align="justify">Our school hopes to encourage all students to ‘Innovate to Make a Difference’, which embodies the school’s aspirations and drive in realising the tenets of our school’s vision of  ‘A Christ-centred and future-oriented learning community where every child will develop her unique giftedness to learn and lead, for others.’</p>

<p align="justify">Through the school’s Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW), we hope to sharpen and develop attributes of the KGOs, such as respect, responsibility, integrity, confident persons, self-directed learners and active contributors.  The ALP is designed to enable all students to be intentional about solving multi-faceted problems by adopting an interdisciplinary perspective and approach.</p>

<h3>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</h3>
<p align="justify">The ALP Programme at Kellock Connects classroom learning with <strong><u>real-life applications</u></strong> and encourages students to <strong><u>creatively apply concepts to solve authentic problems.</u></strong> It focuses on evoking curiosity in learning, developing inventive thinking and encouraging a dare-to-try spirit.</p>

<p align="justify">Our school hopes to encourage all students to <strong><u>‘Innovate to Make a Difference’</u></strong> , which embodies the school’s aspirations and drive in realising the tenets of our school’s vision of  ‘A Christ-centred and future-oriented learning community where every child will develop her unique giftedness to learn and lead, for others.’</p>

<p align="justify">Through the school’s Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW), we hope to sharpen and develop attributes of the KGOs, such as respect, responsibility, integrity, confident persons, self-directed learners and active contributors.  The ALP is designed to enable all students to be intentional about solving multi-faceted problems by adopting an interdisciplinary perspective and approach.</p>

<h6>Our ALP Approach and platforms for students at CHIJ Kellock</h6>
<p align="justify">The ALP will be delivered through a 3-tiered framework; Offer-Nurture-Excel (Similar to the school’s LLP framework). Each tier of the ONE approach takes into consideration our students’ needs, abilities, interests and development of 21st Century Competencies and SEL Competencies, which lead to the  Kellock Girl Outcomes. The 3-tiered frame is designed to allow students to deepen their appreciation and application of skills progressively.</p>

<p align="justify">At the <strong>OFFER</strong> Tier, the school looks at providing a breadth of learning opportunities for students schoolwide. The main vehicles for delivering experiences at this first tier comprise existing programmes such as Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) @ Kellock, Digital Citiznship Education for all levels, and Computational Thinking and Digital Stories at the lower primary levels.  We also design  a STEAM week to inspire our girls into the World of <strong>S</strong>cience, <strong>T</strong>echnology,<strong> E</strong>ngineering &amp; <strong>E</strong>ntrepreneurship, <strong>A</strong>rt and<strong> M</strong>athematics. Students will be involved in fascinating and engaging STEAM-related activities to have experiential learning in a variety of subjects and disciplines. </p>

<p align="justify">The <strong>NURTURE</strong> tier provides in-depth development of the students’ interest while the EXCEL tier allows opportunities for students with the aptitude to excel in their chosen fields or to further stretch their talents.</p>

<p align="justify">To cater to students with aptitude, the school plans for opportunities for selected students to explore and investigate environmental, social and community concerns  / issues at a deeper level through participation in relevant zonal and national presentations and competitions under the EXCEL Tier.</p>

<h4>Learning For Llife Programmme (LLP)</h4>
<p>The school’s LLP – ArtsONE+, is the inclusion of the Self-Regulated Learning Approach to the existing ArtsOne Framework.  The ArtsONE+ guides the design and delivery of the Arts Curriculum and Arts Co-curricular Activities which provide students with experiential learning opportunities that hone the individual’s unique giftedness, ignite her passion in the Arts and encourage her to employ her talents to make a difference in the lives of others.<br><br>
Self-regulated Learning <strong>(SRL)</strong> is a learning process which is cyclical in nature. Students learn and apply through 3 different phases in the SRL cycle: forethought phase, performance phase and self-reflection phase. Through the process of self-regulating their learning, students will develop the values of perseverance, resilience and responsibility. <br><br>
The ArtsONE+, grounded with the SRL approach, seeks to propel our students to be self-directed learners in the area of Arts and cultivate the healthy mind set of Life-long Learning.</p>

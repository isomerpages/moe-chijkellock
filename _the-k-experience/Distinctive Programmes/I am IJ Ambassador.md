<h4>I Am An IJ Ambassador</h4>
<p align="justify">Being part of the larger fraternity of CHIJ schools, CHIJ Kellock enjoys her links with a strong CHIJ heritage and tradition and, therefore, builds on this link by helping her students to develop a sense of affiliation to the CHIJ identity as well as to the school.<br><br>
Helping the students see their ties with the larger CHIJ fraternity is achieved through common symbols, meanings and events found in all the CHIJ schools. The I Am An IJ Ambassador Programme is put in place to ensure that these common symbols and meanings are common touch points that are taught to the students.<br><br>
As an IJ ambassador, ou IJ Kellock Girl will be anchored in the school values as well as in God to focus on the belief that God truly loves her and the Catholic Social Teachings of Human Dignity,  Common Good, Personhood, Solidarity and Subsidiarity. We aspire to see our students work together in solidarity and be connected as a strong, united community in the promotion of truth, justice, freedom, and love.

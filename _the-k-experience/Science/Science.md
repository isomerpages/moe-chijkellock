<h3>Vision / Mission / Philosophy</h3>
<p align="justify">Our vision is to develop scientifically literate (LEARN) future-ready students who can make evidence-based decisions (LEAD) to impact and improve lives (FOR OTHERS).</p>

<p align="justify">Through our Mission, we aim to nurture, in our students, a passion (with purpose) for <strong>Learning</strong> (CCL-Christ-centred Learner) and <strong>Science </strong>(FOL – Future-oriented Leader).</p>

<p align="justify">We believe that Science skills, knowledge and ethics are to be </p>
<ul>
<li>taught (Pedagogy) explicitly, as well as implicitly, through meaningful contexts</li>
<li>learned (Assessment - Curriculum) with the provision of both constructive and timely feedback</li>
<li>applied (Experiences) through the Practices of Science and in collaboration with others</li>
</ul>
<h4>Curriculum</h4>
<p align="justify">The Science Department’s approach to teaching and learning of Science is guided by the following diagram.</p>

<p align="justify">Through the above approach, we aim to provide students with experiences and opportunities to <strong>Inspire</strong> them to build on their interest and stimulate their curiosity. This is carried out through programmes that foster acquisition of basic scientific concepts and develop skills, dispositions and attitudes necessary for scientific <strong>Inquiry</strong>. Through the application of scientific concepts and skills in making responsible decisions, students appreciate how Scientific <strong>Innovations</strong> influence and impact people and the environment.</p>

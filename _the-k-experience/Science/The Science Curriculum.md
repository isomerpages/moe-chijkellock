<h4><strong>SCIENCE BY DESIGN</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Science curriculum is deployed through the 3S Approach to provide SUPPORT for at-risk students, to STRENGTHEN understanding of foundational core concepts for the masses and to STRETCH high-progress students through enrichment. It is aligned to the school&rsquo;s vision of a learning community where the central focus is to develop the unique giftedness of every child.</p>

<p>The Science curriculum at Kellock is concept-based and delivered through various programmes and activities. The design of the Science curriculum is guided by the school&rsquo;s K* Teaching and Learning Framework as well as the MOE CPDD Primary Science Syllabus. The subject-specific pedagogy adopted by the Science Department is that of the 5E Inquiry Approach which is integrated into the various programmes. We believe that it is important that learning be made meaningful through authentic contexts and be facilitated by STEM (Strategies That Engage Minds) so as to enable critical thinking, flexible problem solving and transfer of skills and application of knowledge in new situations.</p>

<h3>Vision / Mission / Philosophy</h3>
<p align="justify">Our vision is to develop scientifically literate (LEARN) future-ready students who can make evidence-based decisions (LEAD) to impact and improve lives (FOR OTHERS).</p>

<p align="justify">Through our Mission, we aim to nurture, in our students, a passion (with purpose) for <strong>Learning</strong> (CCL-Christ-centred Learner) and <strong>Science </strong>(FOL – Future-oriented Leader).</p>

<p align="justify">We believe that Science skills, knowledge and ethics are to be </p>
<ul>
<li>taught (Pedagogy) explicitly, as well as implicitly, through meaningful contexts</li>
<li>learned (Assessment - Curriculum) with the provision of both constructive and timely feedback</li>
<li>applied (Experiences) through the Practices of Science and in collaboration with others</li>
</ul>
<h4>Curriculum</h4>
<p align="justify">The Science Department’s approach to teaching and learning of Science is guided by the following diagram.</p>
<img src="/images/2023/Science/science1.png" style="width: 60%;">
<p align="justify">Through the above approach, we aim to provide students with experiences and opportunities to <strong>Inspire</strong> them to build on their interest and stimulate their curiosity. This is carried out through programmes that foster acquisition of basic scientific concepts and develop skills, dispositions and attitudes necessary for scientific <strong>Inquiry</strong>. Through the application of scientific concepts and skills in making responsible decisions, students appreciate how Scientific <strong>Innovations</strong> influence and impact people and the environment.</p>

<h4>Key Programmes</h4>

<p align="justify">In line with the school’s vision of a future-oriented learning community where every child will develop her unique giftedness to learn and lead for others, the Science (SC) Department uses the STP framework and SLS-PS frame to guide the design and facilitation of the department’s programmes for every Kellock girl to achieve and develop the Kellock Girl Outcomes (KGOs). The KGOs provide a frame for the school to provide the Kellock Experience, a customised Kellock curriculum, which will develop the Kellock girls into Learners and Leaders for Others.</p>


<p align="justify">Programmes are differentiated to cater to the varied learning abilities of the students. There are Support programmes that guide students towards attainment and mastery of specific skills and fundamental knowledge. Stretch programmes provide opportunities and exposure to stretch every child to find her strength and talent. </p>

<p align="justify">Learning experiences specially curated as part of the school-based curriculum include Inter-disciplinary Project Work (IPW), Camps, Learning Journeys to the Science Centre and Museum, and Garden Trails for Outdoor Experiential Learning (OEL).</p>

<p align="justify">Taking into account the profiles of students and interests of the students, programmes in the SC department are specially customised so as to strengthen and enhance the teaching and learning of Science for all.</p>

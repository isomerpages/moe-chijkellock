Key Programmes
In CHIJ Kellock, we believe in the power of technology as a key enabler in transforming teaching and learning. We aim to enrich students’ learning environment and equip them with the necessary competencies to succeed in the 21st century through the various online programmes and platforms.
Singapore Learning Space (SLS)  
The SLS is an online platform with tools and curriculum-aligned resources for all students to learn at their own pace and collaboratively. With the SLS, students can take greater ownership of their learning and pick up skills and habits that prepare them for lifelong learning. In Kellock, teachers use the SLS to complement classroom teaching and learning.

Digital Citizenship Education (DCE)
Digital Citizenship Education (DCE) in Kellock is about teaching and guiding students on the necessary skills, knowledge and issues involving technology to navigate the digital landscape. Students may face complex issues connected to accessing information, online identity, cyber-bullying and self-management. The rising issues on cyber danger and student’s appropriate use of information and tools on the digital landscape create the need to educate and equip students with digital literacy and citizenship skills.

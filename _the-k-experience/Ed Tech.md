<h4>Vision</h4><p>Nurturing a future-oriented learning community to be a Self-directed Learner, Active Contributor, Confident Person and Concerned Citizen</p><p><strong><u>Desired Student Outcomes:</u></strong><br>1. Self-directed learners who take responsibility for their own learning and use technology adeptly to reflect on their own learning and use feedback to improve it.<br>2. Active Contributors who are able to work effectively in teams, take calculated risks and are innovative.<br>3. Confident Persons who have a strong sense of right and wrong and can think independently and critically.<br>4. Concerned Citizens who can behave responsibility towards family, community and nation online.</p><h4>Key Programmes</h4><p>In CHIJ Kellock, we believe in the power of technology as a key enabler in transforming teaching and learning. We aim to enrich students’ learning environment and equip them with the necessary competencies to succeed in the 21st century through the various online programmes and platforms.</p><p><strong><a href="https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Singapore Learning Space (SLS)</u></a></strong><br>The SLS is an online platform with tools and curriculum-aligned resources for all students to learn at their own pace and collaboratively. With the SLS, students can take greater ownership of their learning and pick up skills and habits that prepare them for lifelong learning. In Kellock, teachers use the SLS to complement classroom teaching and learning.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/2023/EdTech/ed%20tech%20poster.jpg"></div><p><strong><u>Digital Citizenship Education (DCE)</u></strong><br></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 60%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/2023/EdTech/ET_1.png"></div><p><br>Digital Citizenship Education (DCE) in Kellock is about teaching and guiding students on the necessary skills, knowledge and issues involving technology to navigate the digital landscape. Students may face complex issues connected to accessing information, online identity, cyber-bullying and self-management. The rising issues on cyber danger and student’s appropriate use of information and tools on the digital landscape create the need to educate and equip students with digital literacy and citizenship skills.<br></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/2023/EdTech/ET_2.png"></div><p><strong><u>Digital Stories</u></strong><br></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 60%;" height="auto" width="30" src="/images/2023/EdTech/ET_3.png"></div><p><br>The objective of Digital Stories is to facilitate the acquisition of 21st century competencies through the powerful medium of storytelling where the students will have a voice to express themselves. Digital storytelling is a powerful way to connect our students to reading, writing, and digital literacy. With the affordance of technology, our young emerging writers can create and publish their own stories. In this programme, students will be given hands on experiences in creating and crafting their own digital stories. Students will learn a variety of digital elements such as storyboarding and incorporating media within a narrative.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="60" src="/images/2023/EdTech/ET_4.png"></div><p><strong><u>Young Computational Thinking</u></strong><br></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="30" src="/images/2023/EdTech/ET_5.png"></div><p><br>The Young Computational Thinking Programme focuses on equipping students with computational thinking (CT) skills. The programme empowers students to apply CT skills in authentic situations and develops students’ critical thinking skills to solve challenging problems in various situations. Lower primary students are given the opportunity to learn CT skills in real world situations and make connections. Upper primary students are exposed to hands-on learning through coding platforms.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="60" src="/images/2023/EdTech/ET_6.png"></div><p></p><p><strong><u>Self-Directed Online Learning Modules </u></strong><br>As part of the school’s efforts in developing the students’ ICT baseline acquisition skills, we have subscribed to Mindclick with online modules which can be accessed from home. These modules are self-directed and will be assigned via SLS.<br><br>They are fully web-based and students can practise touch-typing and MS Office commands anywhere with an Internet connection using a desktop or a laptop. Students are strongly encouraged to complete the modules at home at their own pace. As this is a self-paced learning activity, students would have been given a checklist, instruction manual and FAQs to guide them in the completion of these modules.<br><br>The link will be shared via SLS and students will be informed when it is available. We will also be monitoring the progress online. Students will need to complete these modules according to the schedule given and return the checklist to their class ICT monitors upon completion.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="60" src="/images/2023/EdTech/ET_9.jpg"></div><p></p>

<h4>Vision</h4>
<p align="justify">We aim to inculcate in our students school values, enabling them to become concerned citizens with the strength of character who will step forward to lead and make a difference. </p>
<h4>Mission </h4>
<p align="justify">A Christ-centred learning community where all work together to educate, nurture and develop future-ready, values-centred citizens of tomorrow. </p>
<h4>Pilosophy</h4>
We believe that every child has the potential to live a purposeful life as an individual,  a family member, a friend and a citizen of Singapore and the world. As a school, we can build the character of our students and develop them in the character and citizenship competencies and dispositions that will enable them to make a positive impact on others by contributing to society. </p>
<h4>Curriculum</h4>
<p align="justify">As a part of the total curriculum, classroom lessons for CCE focus on the explicit teaching and learning of values and social-emotional competencies, as well as building and strengthening relationships with fellow students and teachers. CCE in the classroom comprises CCE(FTGP), CCE(MTL) and Programme for Active Learning (PAL). <br><br>

CCE [Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)] involves the explicit teaching and learning of social-emotional skills which are anchored on values and citizenship dispositions. <br><br>
CCE (MTL) aims to deepen the learning of moral values through cultural stories, songs, proverbs, and practices unique to each Mother Tongue Language. The lessons also reinforce the teaching and larning of foundational social-emotional skills. <br><br>
Values Education (VEd) is a customised IJ Kellock programme that involves the explicit teaching and learning of the school values. ‘I Will’ statements developed for the school values are the learning outcomes that the school hopes to see our students attain. </p>

<i>Our School Values</i>

<p align="justify">Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is offered to P1 and P2 levels where experiential learning through the domains of Sports and Games, Outdoor Education and Visual and Performing Arts are conducted. This programme also aims to provide opportunities for students to create, improvise and express their ideas, thoughts and feelings through varied activities that present opportunities for them to work collaboratively in a fun and an enjoyable way.</p>

<h4>Key Programmes</h4>

<p align="justify">CCE is not only confined to learning within the classroom but beyond the classroom. Some of our key student development experiences that contribute towards the holistic development of our students include Values In Action (VIA), Education and Career Guidance, Student Leadership Development, National Education Commemorative Days, IJ Ambassadors and Camps for Life. <br><br>
Camps for Life provide authentic learning experiences where students will have opportunities to apply problem-solving, intra and interpersonal skills. Students practise communication and being sensitive to the views and perspectives of others. Through overcoming challenges, they learn about themselves and what it means to be resilient. <br><br>

Values in Action include everyday responsibilities such as tidying their own work areas and cleaning their classrooms. In addition, students learn to serve the needs of the community through various platforms such as level VIA and volunteerism work initiated by the school. <br><br>
Education and Career Guidance enables students to make informed school choices based on their values, strengths, interests and skills through secondary school talks, vocation talks and experiences that provide opportunities to build their self-awareness. <br><br>
National Commemorative Days enable students to learn about the important milestones of Singapore’s history and how they can play their part to keep Singapore diverse and united.

Tier 3: Leadership for Kellock Executive Committee Prefects</p>

<p><strong><u>National Education (NE)</u></strong></p>
<p>NE comprises a wide range of school efforts that help students experience and explore national identity as Singaporeans, understand the realities and challenges unique to our nation and foster a sense of hope and belonging to Singapore.&nbsp;<em>(Please note that the images in this article were taken before CoVid-19.)</em></p>

<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education (SEd)</u></strong></p>
<p>In this current age, better nutrition and improved health care has resulted in children reaching puberty and sexuality maturity at a younger age. In addition, our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences from the media. Hence, our students require guidance that could help them respond with discernment to the sexual messages in the media and other sources. This programme is conducted over 2 modules for Primary 5 and 6 students by trained Kellock teachers. For more information on this, parents can refer to the designated Sexuality Education webpage in our school&rsquo;s website.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</u></strong></p>
<p>Young people today face a future that will be very different from that experienced by their parents and teachers. ECG is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key educational stage for successful transition from school to further education or work. In Kellock, we organise the Careers Day annually to bring an awareness of the occupations in society that students would be interested to know more about. During CCE (FTGP) lessons, teachers introduce the My Skillsfuture Portal to the P5 and P6 students for them to explore the educational landscape as well as source for information on the occupations in Singapore. We also invite the PSG to collaborate with us to bring in speakers to share about their experiences at work.&nbsp;</p>

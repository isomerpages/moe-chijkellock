<p><strong><u>CCE Lessons</u></strong></p>
<p>These lessons which include CCE (FTGP), CCE EL/MTL, Values Education and Play at Kellock (PAL) provide the time for teachers to engage and build relationships with students through discussions and effective classroom strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Key Student Development Experiences (KSDEs)</u></strong></p>
<p>KSDEs are programmes and activities that contribute towards the holistic development of our students in the physical, aesthetic, intellectual, moral and social domains.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>National Education Commemorative Days</u></strong></p>
<p>Beyond the formal Character and Citizenship Education lessons, the four NE Commemorative Days (Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day) are an important part of students&rsquo; learning experiences in school. Through these NE commemorative days, students learn important lessons from significant moments in Singapore&rsquo;s history, and reflect on how they can apply their learning to contribute as active citizens.</p>
<p><strong><u>Total Defence Day 2022</u></strong></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What is Total Defence?</strong></span></p>
<p>Total Defence involves every person in Singapore playing a part, individually and collectively to build a strong, secure and cohesive Singapore. When we are strong, we are able to deal with any crisis. Total Defence is important in rallying the people in Singapore together in responding to challenges that threatens Singapore&rsquo;s independence and well-being, such as Covid-19 and economic downturns. Everyone in Singapore has an important part to play.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When is Total Defence?</strong></span></p>
<p>Total Defence Day is commemorated on the 15th of February every year. It commemorates the day Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942. The Important Message signal of the Public Warning System is sounded at 6.20pm to commemorate the day, and 6.20pm marks the exact time when the British surrendered to the Japanese Imperial Forces at the Ford Factory in Bukit Timah.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Total Defence @ CHIJ Kellock</strong></span></p>
<p>CHIJ Kellock commemorated Total Defence Day (TDD) on 16th of February this year. The theme for this year&rsquo;s TDD commemoration is &lsquo;Together We Keep Singapore Strong&rsquo;. The objectives of our commemoration is to encourage students to play a greater role in Total Defence and to highlight the different ways students can contribute. Students also learnt about the importance of preparing for future threats and challenges, and showing resilience when crises strike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the school&rsquo;s TDD commemoration programme, a series of 6 different lead-up videos were created by our very own P6 CHIJ Kellock&rsquo;s National Education (NE) Ambassadors. These daily videos which were screened in the morning, provided opportunities for our students to learn about TDD. the 6 different pillars of defence and the different ways in which they can play a part. Our P5 NE Ambassadors contributed by creating information slides which were put up on the school&rsquo;s broadcast system. Our newly-minted P4 NE Ambassadors contributed by helping to set up the learning boards in the canteen in preparation for TDD commemoration.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>P6 NE Ambassadors and their informative videos</em></p>
<p>During their respective level recesses, students visited the learning boards put up in the canteen. These learning boards contain important information on what students can do in the event of first-aid emergencies. Students also picked up fun acitvity sheets (crossword puzzles, colouring sheets) which contain important TDD learning points and messages.</p>
<img style="width: 85%;" src="/images/ecce4.png" />
<p>In the classrooms, students listened to the TDD Message prepared by our Minister for Defence, Dr Ng Eng Heng, before the teachers carried out the level-differentiated customised TDD lesson package in class. These lesson packages aim to strengthen our students&rsquo; understanding and awareness of TDD and to further instill in them on how they can play a part in the six different pillars of defence to protect Singapore. Students then put their gratitude into action by designing and writing Thank You cards to the current and retired National Servicemen in their lives.</p>

<p>This enriching learning experience continued back at home where students completed an interactive&nbsp;&nbsp;TDD&nbsp;&nbsp;learning package on the Student Learning Space (SLS) portal. Students learnt on how to react during times of&nbsp;emergency.</p>
<p>We look forward to our Kellock girls putting what they have learnt into actions and play their part to defend and protect Singapore.</p>
<p>Remember, together we make Singapore strong!</p>

<p><strong><u>Camps for Life&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p>In Kellock, we believe in exposing our students to learning beyond the classroom. Hence, we have put in place the Camps for Life programme where students go through a structured level camp. Through the camps, students learn to work as a team, strengthen their bonds with one another and acquire social emotional skills such as empathy and perspective-taking.</p>

<p>To help our students internalise the knowledge, skills and values (KSV) that they have learnt, we create platforms for them to apply their KSVs. For this, we have the I Care, We Care &amp; We Care+ framework that we have put in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the I Care level, we offer opportunities to all students through class VIA such as spring cleaning and daily 5-minute routine cleaning of their work areas.</p>
<p>At the We Care level, we develop the students&rsquo; empathy and love for the community through level VIA and some of these activities include creating a hamper for OSO staff and financial bazaar.</p>
<p>At the We Care+ level, platforms are created for students to sign up voluntarily for these activities on their own accord. These platforms hope to bring out the volunteerism spirit in our students.&nbsp;</p>

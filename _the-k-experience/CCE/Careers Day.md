<h4><strong>Virtual Careers Day 2021 &ndash; Our Collaboration with Kellock Parents Support Group</strong></h4>
<p>A BBC Journalist, vet, fitness instructor and architect &hellip; these were just some of the professionals who shared for our very first Virtual Careers Day at CHIJ Kellock. CHIJ Kellock was honoured to have many guest speakers who volunteered their time and effort for our virtual Careers Day this year. We were privilege to have these parent volunteers, who stepped forward to share with our students interesting stories about their profession and the challenges that they faced at the workplace through video recordings. It was a meaningful session as our students learned more about what it takes to work in the various professions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the help of our Kellock Parents Support Group, the exciting line up of virtual career sharing by the various professionals this year was engaging and well received by Kellock students.</p>

<h4><strong>Music Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>The school&rsquo;s teaching and learning of Music covers the following 3 aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Listen and Respond to Music&nbsp;</li>
<li>Perform Music</li>
<li>Create Music</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>*Framework for teaching and learning in the GMP &ndash; 2015 Music Syllabus Guide</strong></em></p>
<p>The Music Department applied the Orff-inspired Approach in our teaching and learning of music. Through this approach, our students express themselves through singing, movement, music creation and playing of instruments. They are encouraged to share their views and opinions through music appreciation of varied genres.</p>
<p>By the end of their 6-years education in CHIJ Kellock, our students would have the opportunity to learn different instruments ranging from percussion to string to wind.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">P1 &ndash; Classroom percussion instrument&nbsp;<br />P2 &ndash; Kompang&nbsp;<br />P3 &ndash; Chime Bars&nbsp;<br />P4 &ndash; Recorder&nbsp;<br />P5/6 &ndash; Ukulele&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many opportunities for students to showcase what they have learnt, such as performing as an ensemble with these instruments in class and at recess recitals.</p>

<p><strong>Description:<br /></strong>The design of Kellock&rsquo;s Creative Arts Programme is based on the ArtsONE Framework where students, regardless of their backgrounds and abilities, are provided with broad-based, quality creative arts education through the curriculum and co-curriculum programmes. These programmes actively engage pupils at different levels, depending on needs, interests and talents. Through the 6-years Arts Education, apart from skills learnt, our pupils will experience and learn the importance of graciousness, humility, perseverance and teamwork.</p>
<h4><strong>Working hand in hand</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Parents can help:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage and support your child to participate in the Arts related activities organised for pupils.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Encourage your child to practise on the instrument which she is learning for the year.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Encourage your child to keep an open-mind to the learning opportunities that are presented to them.</li>
</ul>

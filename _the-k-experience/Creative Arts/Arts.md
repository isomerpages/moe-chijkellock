Key Programmes
By the end of their 6-years in CHIJ Kellock, our students would have learnt how to use various art materials to create art pieces that express their imagination, feelings and perception. Through their 2-D and 3-D art making process, students learn about art elements and principles of design. Art journaling is an important aspect in our students’ art making process through which students sketch and jot down their ideation process as well as their reflection.

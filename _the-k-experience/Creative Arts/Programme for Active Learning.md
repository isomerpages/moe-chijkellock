<h4>Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</h4>
‘PIay encourages creativity and imagination. lt is intellectually, socially, emotionally, physically and linguistically challenging and encourages children to work in depth (alone and with others).’ (Pound, 2008, How Children Learn, Learning Through Play, p74)

Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is an initiative from MOE which sees the inclusion of structured playtime into the curriculum. Here in CHIJ Kellock, PAL is an acronym for Play and Learn, simply for the reason that through structured ‘play’ time, students acquire social emotional skills such as managing self and others as well as skills to make responsible decisions.

Our Vision

The Holistic Health Education (HHE) Department aims to nurture thoughtful and reflective learners who are physically active and competent in movement. We believe that through Physical Education (PE) and Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), students will develop character, confidence and resilience, empowering them to advocate the importance of leading an active and healthy lifestyle in others.
Curriculum
At CHIJ Kellock, PE offers opportunities for students to experience a comprehensive and broad-based HHE curriculum where they will learn the necessary skills, knowledge and attitudes that enable them to become efficient, effective and versatile in movement. 
Throughout their 6 years in the school, students will be exposed to the breadth of learning experiences in the following learning areas:
Athletics (from Primary 3)
Dance
Games and Sports
Gymnastics
Outdoor Education
Physical Health and Fitness
Swimming (by end of Primary 6)


During Health Education lessons, students learn about the importance of being physically active and maintaining a balanced diet in their pursuit of an active and healthy lifestyle. To help their peers apply good health practices in nutrition and exercise, students are appointed as Food and Health Ambassadors to:


support peers in making wise food choices according to “My Healthy Plate” during recess
encourage peers to bring healthy snacks during snack break 
Key Programmes
To seed the passion for sports in students, the HHE Department also organises a variety of physical activities for students to gain exposure to a variety of sporting experiences and provide them with multiple opportunities to explore their interests and discover their strengths. 
Beyond the PE Syllabus, students learn and enjoy sports at school through the following programmes:

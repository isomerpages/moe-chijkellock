<p>The aim of Learn-to-Play programme is to provide opportunities for students to build their interest in sports and develop sports-specific skills. We collaborate with secondary school sports teams from CHIJ Secondary School and Outram Secondary School to co-facilitate Learn-to-Play Badminton and Frisbee sessions respectively.</p>

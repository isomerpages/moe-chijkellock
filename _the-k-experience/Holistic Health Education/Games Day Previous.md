<p>Games Day has been a longstanding tradition of CHIJ Kellock since 1964. It is a special day where students, teachers and parents all come together to play and celebrate with each other through fun games and activities. In Kellock's early years, Games Day was held on a muddy field where students often lost their shoes if they stepped into the mud.</p>
<p>In the recent years, Games Day is conducted in the various venues in school such as the Kellock Sports Hall, Mathilde Hall and the Gymnasium. Games Day remains a fun-filled day for everyone throughout the years with inter-house games, cheering competitions and teachers&rsquo; race.</p>

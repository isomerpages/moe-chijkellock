Joy Of Learning Programme
(P1 and P2 Home-Based Programme)
P1 and P2 Home-based Programme “Joy of Learning” is creatively conceptualised and designed by the Mother Tongue department to encourage our students to continue using their Mother Tongue language beyond the classroom with their parents. We believe that through this authentic learning platform, students’ interest in learning their Mother Tongue can be further cultivated.


Students have to complete all the tasks stated on the task card page, which is incorporated into a specially designed booklet, with all the resources related to the various tasks included. For each task that the students complete, they will be awarded stars. The number of stars will be allocated based on the difficulty of the task as well as the involvement of the parents. Once the students are awarded 10 stars, they will be given a star sticker, which is part of the resources of this home-based learning kit to motivate them to participate. 


Hari Raya Celebrations @ Kellock
Hari Raya Aidil Fitri, or the festival of Eid, marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, and the start of a new month on the Islamic calendar, Syawal. Hari Raya Aidil Fitri is a celebration of victory in completing the fast and overcoming personal struggles during the Ramadan. It is also a time of forgiveness and strengthening of bonds amongst family members.


The Malay Department puts up decorations and an information board on Hari Raya celebrations which focus on our Malay traditional costumes, food and delicacies during the Hari Raya festival. We display some samples of baju kurung and baju kebaya, which are the traditional dresses of Malay ladies, at our booth. Our students also have the opportunity to attempt the ‘Let's Celebrate Hari Raya at Kellock’ quiz via the SLS online platform and win tokens for themselves. Writing greeting cards to Muslim friends who celebrate the Hari Raya is another favourite of the girls.

<h3>Holistic Health Education (HHE)</h3><h4>Our Vision</h4><p>The Holistic Health Education (HHE) Department aims to nurture thoughtful and reflective learners who are physically active and competent in movement. We believe that through Physical Education (PE) and Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), students will develop character, confidence and resilience, empowering them to advocate the importance of leading an active and healthy lifestyle in others.</p><h4>Curriculum</h4><p>At CHIJ Kellock, PE offers opportunities for students to experience a comprehensive and broad-based HHE curriculum where they will learn the necessary skills, knowledge and attitudes that enable them to become efficient, effective and versatile in movement. <br><br>Throughout their 6 years in the school, students will be exposed to the breadth of learning experiences in the following learning areas:<br></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Athletics (from Primary 3)</p></li><li><p>Dance</p></li><li><p>Games and Sports</p></li><li><p>Gymnastics</p></li><li><p>Outdoor Education</p></li><li><p>Physical Health and Fitness</p></li><li><p>Swimming (by end of Primary 6)</p></li></ul><p> During Health Education lessons, students learn about the importance of being physically active and maintaining a balanced diet in their pursuit of an active and healthy lifestyle.

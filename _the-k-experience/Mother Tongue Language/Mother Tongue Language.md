<h3>Mother Tongue</h3>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Department aims to foster a community
of 21st century learners and critical thinkers who are confident speakers
of their Mother Tongue Languages and appreciate its cultural values.</p>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>We aim to develop our students to become future-oriented learners who
are able to communicate in their Mother Tongue language confidently, therefore
enabling them to connect with others through the language to learn about
its cultural values.</p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The department offers Chinese Language, Tamil Language and Malay Language.
In addition to the MOE syllabus, the MTL Department provides a customised
curriculum that caters to the needs of our students. The curriculum aims
to develop our students to achieve our Kellock Girls Outcomes, so as to
become Future-Oriented Learners.</p>

<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight</strong>
<br>Mother Tongue Fortnight was mooted in 2012 by MOE to encourage the use
of Mother Tongue languages among students. The theme that our school adopts
is Language Unlocks Culture, Culture Reflects Values. This is in line with
our objective of having more cultural activities in the context of an IJ
school.</p>
<p><strong>P4 Mother Tongue Language and Cultural Camp</strong> Every year,
a Language and Cultural camp will be organised for all P4 students to provide
them with an immersive environment to learn about the use of Mother Tongue
Languages (MTL), and to appreciate the respective MTL cultures through
hands-on tasks.</p>
<p><strong>P5 Mother Tongue Enrichment Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The programme is designed for P5 students taking standard CL, ML and TL
respectively. This is a customised programme designed to introduce the
various components of language learning in P5, along with department-specific
strategies aimed at deepening students’ understanding. It follows a distinct
SOW that is different from the one used during curriculum time.</p>
<h4>Highlights</h4>
<p><strong>Parents can help in the following ways:</strong>
<br>Encourage your child to speak to family members in both Mother Tongue
and English as the learning of languages begins at home. Build your child’s
confidence in using Mother Tongue by not excessively correcting her mistakes.
<br>
<br>Encourage your child to read good Mother Tongue and English books. You
may wish to get audio books, electronic books or books with attractive
illustrations and relatively fewer words if your child is a beginning reader.
When she is more prepared, you can choose books with more words.
<br>
<br>Expose your child to good Mother Tongue and English programmes, for example,
animation features such as cartoons. This provides an alternative avenue
for your child to be exposed to Mother Tongue. It would also be good to
build up her language proficiency by allowing her to play meaningful games
while using the language.</p>

<h3>Tamil Language</h3><h4>Joy Of Learning Programme</h4><p><strong><u>(P1 and P2 Home-Based Programme)</u></strong><br>P1 and P2 Home-based Programme “Joy of Learning” is creatively conceptualised and designed by the Mother Tongue department to encourage our students to continue using their Mother Tongue language beyond the classroom with their parents. We believe that through this authentic learning platform, students’ interest in learning their Mother Tongue can be further cultivated.<br></p><p>Students have to complete all the tasks stated on the task card page, which is incorporated into a specially designed booklet, with all the resources related to the various tasks included. For each task that the students complete, they will be awarded stars. The number of stars will be allocated based on the difficulty of the task as well as the involvement of the parents. Once the students are awarded 10 stars, they will be given a star sticker, which is part of the resources of this home-based learning kit to motivate them to participate.</p><p></p><p><strong><u>Deepavali Celebrations @ Kellock</u></strong><br>During the Festival of Lights, Deepavali, which marks the triumph of good over evil and, symbolically, light over darkness, students take part in various activities organised by the Tamil Department. They are exposed to the significance of celebrating Deepavali through the Deepavali Display on Indian traditional costumes, food and hands-on activities.</p><p><strong><u>P6 CHIJ COMBINED SCHOOLS TAMIL LANGUAGE &amp; CULTURAL CAMP</u></strong><br>CHIJ Combined Schools organise the above-mentioned activity for our Primary 6 students offering the Tamil Language. <br></p><p>The objectives of this camp are to provide opportunities for our students to: enhance their knowledge of the historical and cultural heritage of the Tamil Language through interactive station activities; and bond and strengthen their friendships with fellow CHIJ students.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:60;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/2023/MotherTongue/ctl.jpg"></div><p><em>Joy Of Learning Programme</em></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:60;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/2023/MotherTongue/tl1.jpg"></div><p><em>Deepavali Celebration @ Kellock</em></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:60;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/2023/MotherTongue/TL_5.jpg"></div><p><em>P6 CHIJ COMBINED SCHOOLS TAMIL LANGUAGE &amp; CULTURAL CAMP</em></p>

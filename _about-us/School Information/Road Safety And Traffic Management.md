<h4>Road Safety And Traffic Management</h4><p>We take the health and personal safety of all individuals – students, stakeholders, staff and visitors, seriously. All individuals are expected to familiarise themselves with the traffic management measures and to follow instructions spelt out hereunder for the safety and security of all.</p><p><strong><u>1. Road Safety</u></strong><br></p><p>The safety of our students using roads leading to and from the school is our priority and the responsibility of all. We continue to seek the cooperation of parents / guardians to work with us in ensuring their children’s safety coming to and leaving the school. Parents / guardians who are drivers should continue to play their part by slowing down as they approach the vicinity of the school. As a parent / guardian, do help us to reinforce the importance of road safety with your children. <br></p><p>Thus, we would appreciate parents to remind their children to:</p><p></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>practice the kerb drill before crossing the road – “look right, look left, look right again, ensure all vehicles have stopped, raise your hand high up and cross the road briskly”.</p></li><li><p>refrain from using their mobile communication devices or reading books when crossing the road.</p></li><li><p>avoid standing at the edge of the bus bay and / or leaning / resting on the safety bollards at the bus stop.</p></li></ul><p><strong><u>2.

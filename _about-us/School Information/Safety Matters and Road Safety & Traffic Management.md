The safety of our students using roads leading to and from the school is our priority and the responsibility of all. We continue to seek the cooperation of parents/guardians to work with us in ensuring their children’s safety coming to and leaving the school. Parents/Guardians who are drivers should continue to play their part by slowing down as they approach the vicinity of the school. As a parent/guardian, do help us to reinforce the importance of road safety with the students. The roads can be very busy and dangerous, especially before the start of school and at dismissal time. Thus, we would appreciate parents to remind their children to: 

* practice the kerb drill before crossing the road – “look right, look left, look right again, ensure all vehicles have stopped, raise your hand high up and cross the road briskly”. 
* refrain from using their mobile communication devices or reading books when crossing the road as such usage/behaviours would distract them from the road conditions and the movement of vehicles around them.
* avoid standing at the edge of the bus bay and/or leaning/resting on the safety bollard at the bus stop which is meant to prevent speeding vehicles from ploughing further into bus stop, and reduce the risk of direct impact on commuters there. 

On a note of gratitude, we are grateful for the invaluable contribution of all parents/guardians who have been supportive of our efforts in making traffic flow at our school smooth and ensuring the safety of the girls and traffic marshals, including themselves at the daily arrival and dismissal times. We appreciate their adherence to the following: 

* driving into the school carefully, via Gate 2, meant for P1 to P3 girls with valid 2020 Pink Car Decals clearly displayed on the left side of the windscreen; 
* alighting the older girls from P4 to P6 at either the car park facility between Block 110 and Block 111 of Bukit Purmei Road (behind the temple) or along Bukit Teresa Road at pedestrian Gate 1P; 
* being mindful of the traffic congestion in the morning and respecting the ‘No Right Turn’ sign put up by LTA to refrain from turning right from Bukit Teresa Road to Kampong Bahru Road between 7.00 am and 7.30 am; and 
* exercising care when driving into the school at dismissal time, between 1.45 pm and 2.00 pm, as well as between 3.30 pm and 5.30 pm to pick up their daughters. 

We would like to reiterate that the safety of all cannot be taken for granted and hence urge all parents/guardians to continue to collaborate with the school on safety and security regulations when they are coming into the school.

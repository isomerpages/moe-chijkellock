Train up a child in the way she should go,

<b><u>DISCIPLINE PHILOSOPHY</u></b>

CHIJ Kellock believes that a safe and orderly environment, marked by a culture of graciousness, respect and love for self, peers and teachers, is necessary for learning to take place. Every child has the right to a safe school environment and an environment that is conducive to learning. Therefore, it is the responsibility of every student to contribute to the building of a caring and loving learning environment through self-management and the modelling of school values in everyday life in and out of school. 

Discipline Approach

CHIJ Kellock’s approach to discipline is student-centric, cultivating in and teaching every child:
•	An awareness of her personal traits and her emotions: I AM (self-awareness)
•	An understanding of her responses and choices to situations: I CAN (self-management)
•	An awareness and understanding of others’ emotions and perspectives: I CARE (social awareness)
•	How best to express herself in socially acceptable ways to build healthy relationships and manage conflicts: I WILL (self-management)

When a student misbehaves, the process of discipline starts with helping her to be aware of her emotions and her actions, the effect her actions and behaviour have on others, followed by intervention measures and support structures for her to be back on track. The intervention measures are guided by the school’s rules and regulations while the support structures help the child move forward with empathy and with new learning. 

Intervention measures, depending on the severity of the actions, can be facilitative in nature or punitive. Support structures range from mandatory counselling, to reflective practices, reinforcing the iterative discipline process of “I AM, I CAN, I CARE AND I WILL”.  

The student-centric approach to discipline that the school takes in handling a discipline case can be seen as follows: 

I AM (Self Awareness)

When a student commits an offence, it is important that she reflects on her own actions, deriving at an awareness of her personal traits and emotions. Questions for reflection include: 
•	What happened?
•	What was I thinking at that time?
•	Who do I think have been affected by what I have done?
•	What exactly am I sorry for?

I CAN (Self-Management)

Upon reflecting further, it is important that the student develops an understanding of her responses and choices to the situations and devises steps she can do to make amendments. Questions for reflection include:
•	What do I need to do to make things right?
•	How can I make sure that this does not happen again?

I CARE (Social Awareness)

It is important that the student develops an understanding of the emotions of others and takes on the perspective of others. Questions for reflection include:
•	How has my action affected others?
•	In what way was the victim affected?

I WILL (Responsible Decision-Making)

At this stage, the student will come to a realisation that she needs to express herself in socially acceptable ways to build healthy relationships and manage conflicts. She will then express the actions that she needs to take to show her desire to turn over a new leaf. Some I WILL statements include:
•	I will resolve to treat my friends with respect.
•	I will learn to work with others and I will surface issues to my teacher and not insist on my own ways.

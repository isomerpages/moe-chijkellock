It is the badge of all CHIJ schools the world over. The red shield has a silver band edged in gold. On the right side is the Book of the Gospels with a silver Rosary, on the left is a golden Distaff and Spindle. The Shield, surmounted by a Gold Cross is encircled by a garland of Marguerites.</p><p>The Motto on the badge is as follows: “<strong>Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty”</strong></p><h4>The Significance of the Symbols</h4><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>The Cross is the symbol of our Salvation and of the suffering and death of our Lord, Jesus Christ</p></li><li><p>The Gospel, representing the teaching of Christ, is a guide of our life.</p></li><li><p>The Rosary of the Virgin Mary symbolizes prayer – communication with God</p></li><li><p>The Distaff and the Spindle are symbols of womanly labour, typical of an earlier period when the weaving of cloth was done by women at home.

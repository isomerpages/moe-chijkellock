<p>Dear Parents and My Dear Girls</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s wishing you God&rsquo;s abundant blessings as we usher in a brand new year!</p>
<p>Anchored in our CHIJ Mission to be &lsquo;A Christ-centred school community where all work together for the promotion of truth, justice, freedom and love, with special reference to the needs of the persons who are disadvantaged in any way&rsquo;, Kellock will continue to move ahead in the pursuit of ensuring that our girls, as women leaders with a voice of their own, are ready to face their future confidently and competently. We will continue to develop in our girls both the hard and soft skills to navigate the complexities and uncertainties of their future world. As a school and as a community, we will provide them with the strong fundamentals in terms of the experiences, values, competencies, skills and dispositions that they need to embrace their future.</p>
<p>Kellock continues to be a close-knit community of staff, parents, alumni and partners who work hand-in-hand to support the growth of our girls and love them unconditionally. We value our partnership with all our stakeholders who are an important part of the Kellock family and we look forward to your continued support in bringing out the best in our girls so that they will be confident women who are thoughtful learners, servant leaders and persons for others.</p>
<p>We thank God for his countless blessings on our Kellock family. The challenges around us continue to persist but we know that with our collective will, human spirit, resilience, and most importantly, God&rsquo;s grace, we can embrace all that lies before us, and emerge stronger and victorious.</p>
<p>Let us welcome the New Year courageously and seek God&rsquo;s continued blessings over the CHIJ Kellock family. Venturing into the new school year, let us continue to persevere together for the best of our girls.</p>
<p>A very happy and blessed New Year!</p>

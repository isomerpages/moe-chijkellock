<p align="center">“For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith – and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of the God.” 
<b>Ephesians 2:8</b></p>
<br>
<p align="justify">Faith is at the heart of a Catholic education. Faith formation is more than learning from a book. It is learning to live the faith each day. At CHIJ Kellock, the Catholic parents of the school entrust their children to our care and together, we take shared responsibility for the faith formation of the children, our students. Faith formation at CHIJ Kellock gives students an opportunity to know and experience God’s love, to walk their journey of faith with their friends and teachers, and to become faith-filled children of God, resting in the belief that God truly loves them. </p>

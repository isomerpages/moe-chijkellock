<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>The CHIJ Kellock Parent Support Group (PSG) is made up of parent volunteers
who work closely with the school to strengthen school-home collaboration
and partnership to foster shared interests and responsibilities for the
children and promote parental involvement in school programmes.</p>
<h4>Our Objectives</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To facilitate parents supporting the girls in school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To engage with the parents and create an inclusive school community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To contribute towards developing future ready skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To foster sisterly love in school, for the girls to be Christ-centred</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To serve the disadvantaged in our midst through volunteerism</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Programmes/ Highlights</h4>
<p>
<br><strong>K-Marshals</strong>
</p>
<p>This group of Parent Volunteers are at the heart ♥ of our traffic management
for P1-P3 girls who are driven and dropped off in school via Gate 2 in
the mornings from 7.00 a.m. – 7.30 a.m. Parent Volunteers are usually on
duty once a week, opening doors for our little ones as they arrive at school
for a brand-new day of learning.</p>
<p><strong>K-Gardening Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Parent Volunteers (K-Gardeners)are entrusted to respectfully care for
the school’s rooftop edible garden - Laudato Si’. They learn the art of
plant cultivation and champion the school’s on-going Sustainability Movement.
This is a hands-on and experiential approach to promote a deeper appreciation
of nature while fostering greater social interaction amongst the Kellock
Parent community.</p>
<p><strong>K-Chaplaincy</strong>
</p>
<p>Our parents in the Chaplaincy group work closely to support our Chaplaincy
teachers with their programme and activities in school for the girls.
<br>These include Lenten activities, Termly rosary prayer sessions, Parent-child
faith formation activities at the end of each semester, Rosary making for
the new P1 Kellock girls and assisting with School plays (e.g. All Saints’
Day and Nativity plays). All efforts are driven to make Christ known and
loved in CHIJ Kellock.</p>
<h4>PSG Events</h4>

Kellock parent community also assist to plan, support, and execute some
of the following events in school:</p>

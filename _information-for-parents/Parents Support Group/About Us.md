<h3>About Us</h3>
<p align="justify">The CHIJ Kellock Parent Support Group (PSG) is made up of parent volunteers who work closely with the school to strengthen school-home collaboration and partnership to foster shared interests and responsibilities for the children and promote parental involvement in school programmes.</p>
<h4>Our Objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>To facilitate parents supporting the girls in school</li>
<li>To engage with the parents and create an inclusive school community</li>
<li>To contribute towards developing future ready skills</li>
<li>To foster sisterly love in school, for the girls to be Christ-centred</li>
<li>To serve the disadvantaged in our midst through volunteerism</li>
</ul>

<h4>Programmes/ Highlights</h4><br>
<strong>K-Marshals</strong>
<p align="justify">This group of Parent Volunteers are at the heart ♥ of our traffic management for P1-P3 girls who are driven and dropped off in school via Gate 2 in the mornings from 7.00 a.m. – 7.30 a.m.
Parent Volunteers are usually on duty once a week, opening doors for our little ones as they arrive at school for a brand-new day of learning. </p>

<strong>K-Gardening Programme</strong> 
<p align="justify">Parent Volunteers (K-Gardeners)are entrusted to respectfully care for the school’s rooftop edible garden - Laudato Si’.
They learn the art of plant cultivation and champion the school’s on-going Sustainability Movement. This is a hands-on and experiential approach to promote a deeper appreciation of nature while fostering greater social interaction amongst the Kellock Parent community. </p>

<strong>K-Chaplaincy</strong>
<p align="justify">Our parents in the Chaplaincy group work closely to support our Chaplaincy teachers with their programme and activities in school for the girls. <br>
These include Lenten activities, Termly rosary prayer sessions, Parent-child faith formation activities at the end of each semester, Rosary making for the new P1 Kellock girls and assisting with School plays (e.g. All Saints’ Day and Nativity plays). All efforts are driven to make Christ known and loved in CHIJ Kellock.</p>
